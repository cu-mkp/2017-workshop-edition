## Colors for green leaves

 
One usually paints them in <span class="m">oil</span>, because <span class="m">distemper</span> colors have no hold. For <span class="pa">marigold flowers</span>, <span class="m">lightly ground minium</span> for some, & for others which are more yellowish, a bit of <span class="m">massicot</span> with it. For green, the <span class="m">verdigris</span> has depth & is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the <span class="m">verdigris</span> a little <span class="m">yellow ochre</span> & <span class="m">stil de grain yellow</span>. If the green is dark, put with it <span class="m">charcoal of <span class="pa">peach tree</span> pits</span>, which makes a <span class="del">v</span> greenish black, in the same way that black of <span class="m"><span class="al">ox</span> foot bone</span> looks bluish. And thus, by judgement & discretion, put the color on the <span class="m">natural flower or leaf</span> to see whether it comes close. But layer it transparently so as not to cover the lines of the work.
 
 
  

## Large molds

 
Because of the heaviness of the metal, it is necessary to put them in a press so that they do not open.
 
 
  

## Candle smoke

 
It allows the piece to be taken out more easily, and even if it is slightly thick, it does not stick because it has no substance. I have perfumed my core molds this way for tin and lead, and I have casted in a cold mold, but drying it well beforehand, and the piece came out quite cleanly. It is true that lead mixed with half the quantity of tin, because the medal was very thick, was very hot.
 
 
  

## Casts

 
If the medal is very thick, do not pour a cast that is as thick; the cast just needs to be half as thick as the medal. But if it is thin, make a cast that is of the same thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the cast or the whole matter will fill with bubbles.
