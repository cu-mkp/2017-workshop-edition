## <span class="m">Gemstones</span>

 
Take white <span class="m">pebbles</span> that are found along rivers & along gravel banks, & paths and that are somewhat transparent. If they are perfectly transparent, & it will be better. If not, use the best & whitest ones that you can find. Calcine them three or 4 times in your <span class="tl">four à vent</span> & quench them in <span class="m">water</span> or <span class="m">vinegar</span>. Then, take a <span class="ms">℥</span> of them and pound them in a completely pure <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> mortar</span>, & with a <span class="tl">pestle of pure <span class="m">copper</span></span>, and grind them until they become very fine & soft powder; this is a sign that they have taken enough of the substance of<span class="m">copper</span> to give them greenness. Then in your <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">pebbles</span>, add in three <span class="ms">℥</span> of good <span class="m">minium</span>, unadulterated by <span class="m">brick</span> & something else, and strongly pound everything together again in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">bronze</span> mortar</span>. And in all of this, add in a <span class="ms">gros</span> <span class="add"><span class="del">pour</span> <span class="del"><span class="ms">℥</span></span></span> of <span class="m">sel de verre</span>, & some & the common people put in <span class="m">sandever</span> that they find it among the <span class="pro">glassmakers</span> or <span class="pro">apothecaries</span>. But <span class="m">alkali salt</span>, as you know, is better.

 In this way, the vulgaire makes <span class="m">emeralds</span> & casts them in sand. If you do not have a <span class="tl"><span class="m">bronze</span> mortar</span>, crush <span class="del">avecqun mort</span> in a <span class="tl">cauldron of pure <span class="m">copper</span></span>.

When one says: for <span class="ms">℥</span>, what is to be understood is: an <span class="ms">℥</span> of body & not of <span class="m">salts</span> & <span class="m">minium</span>. 
 
 
  

## For <span class="m">ruby</span> take <span class="m">gold</span>in leaves

 
Raise your <span class="tl">stove</span> by two <span class="tl">tiles</span> all around because more heat is needed to make <span class="m">rubies</span> than <span class="m">emeralds</span>. And take an <span class="ms">℥</span> of white, calcined <span class="m">pebbles</span>, and put it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> mortar</span> &, having roughly pounded it with the same kind of <span class="tl">pestle</span>, mix <span class="del">un <span class="ms">grain</span></span> in the weight of a <span class="ms">grain</span> of <span class="m">gold</span> leaves of the kind used by <span class="pro">painters</span> for gilding, & crush.

>   Some say that mixing the <span class="m">gold</span> with <span class="m">pebbles</span> and <span class="m">saltpeter</span> gives the color of a <span class="pa">peach tree</span>
.
