*[continued]*
  
<span class="m">Earth</span>, or sand, moistened or ground with <span class="m">water</span>, wants to be reheated more than sand.
 
<span class="m">Latten from a candlestick</span> is not pure, for one mixes in it <span class="m">iron filings</span> & <span class="m">potin</span>.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> wants to be cast hotter than <span class="m">copper</span>, quod non credo.
 
One ought not, to cast carefully, to take <span class="m">metals already alloyed</span>, but take them pure & mix them.
 
<span class="m">Iron</span> hardly agrees with being cast in a mixture of <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">latten</span>.
 
It is better all with a sand, either in a <span class="tl">frame</span> or noyau at once, rather than several mixed.

In the end feed and stoke the fire, & when the flame is very white & that the substance will be in a liquid bain like <span class="m">water</span> & casting off pale blue flames, cast. The secret is to cast <span class="add">very</span> hot & in one go.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lean white sand</span>

 
Without bond renders well proper for casting, & having body, if you grind it very finely on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span> or calcine it, reddening it several times in the fire, & being in <span class="m">vinegar</span>, or finely ground with <span class="m">water</span> as you know, it also molds very neatly in noyau, as I have experimented. But do not moisten it with <span class="m">salt water</span> if you want to quickly reheat it, for <span class="m">salt</span> boils on the fire & makes bubbles, being pressed by the fire. I believe that the noyau, gently reheated, would not do this. I molded very neatly in noyau the <span class="m">substance of skillets</span>. <span class="m">White sand</span> <span class="sn">smells like <span class="m">sulphur</span></span> when reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been cast in it, it acquires in the <span class="tl">mold</span> <span class="del">co<span class="exp">mm</span>e</span> a luster as if it were <span class="m">leaded</span> or vitrified. I believe that <span class="pro">glassmakers</span> could use it.

## Bell handles

 
 They can be put back on, without remaking the bell, which one ought to put back in the pit, & and mold it there. But should you <span class="m">solder</span> a <span class="del">ref</span> cracked bell, it is considered impossible to give it its first voice.
