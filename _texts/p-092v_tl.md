## <span class="m">Sand from <span class="env">river</span> <span class="al">tellins</span> and <span class="al">mussels</span></span>

 
 The long <span class="m"><span class="al">shells</span></span> that can be found in <span class="env">fresh river waters</span>, once calcined, makes an impalpable white sand, which moulds very neatly.
 
 
  

## Freezing <span class="m">mercury</span>

 
It freezes, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span> in a rather large <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> posnet</span>, putting in, for an <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">☿</span>, ii <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">verdet</span> <span class="del">de</span> and <span class="m">vitriol of saltpetre</span>, <span class="ms">ana</span>, with sufficient quantity of <span class="m">old water from <span class="pro">mareschaulx</span></span>.
 
Or else, melt 4 <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">tin</span>, & as it cools, purify it of its <span class="m">filth</span>, which is on top, then, make a hole in it & put in there i <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">☿</span> & it will come out like <span class="m">tin</span> if you remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is <span class="m">tin</span> or <span class="m">☿</span>, redden a <span class="tl">shovel</span> & put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is <span class="m">tin</span>, it will melt & stay, but if it is <span class="m">☿</span>, will quickly melt, then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to freeze it in a <span class="tl">spoon</span> or in a <span class="tl">hollow crucible</span>, & make a moderately sized hole.
 
It can also be frozen, as I assayed, in <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> which beforehand will have eaten a little <span class="m">silver</span>. This one, mixed, makes <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="m">lead</span> run.
 
 
  

## Mixture

 
<span class="m">Fine tin</span>, <span class="m">frozen mercury</span> with the smell of <span class="m">tin</span>, <span class="m">looking glass tin</span>, <span class="m">fine lead</span>, <span class="ms">as much of one as the other</span>, makes a substance that melts very quickly, but breakable & white. I think that it would be good for <span class="m">solder</span>. A long time to cool.
