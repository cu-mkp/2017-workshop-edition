## Molding very thin like<span class="pro">bimbalotiers</span> do

 
They mould in <span class="m">paper</span> or <span class="m">cardboard</span>, because neither sandy <span class="m">earth</span> nor <span class="m">metal</span> would mold so neatly and would not receive. Or they engrave with <span class="m">stone</span> from <span class="pl">Istre</span>, for the main side, and the reverse is in <span class="m">paper</span> or <span class="m">cardboard</span>.
 
 
  

## Reducing a round form into a hollow one

 
You must firstly mold it with <span class="m">plaster</span> as has been said before, and in the <span class="m">plaster</span> throw in some <span class="m">wax</span> from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure. Then you will mold this <span class="m">wax</span> relief once more in <span class="m">plaster</span>, or even better with your tempered sand, #, as if for a noyau. And in the latter throw in some <span class="m">lead</span> and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is not, repair it on <span class="m">cement</span> or a similar material, and beware that it should always release well. And this one will always serve you as a model for making as many hollow molds as you would like. In this way, place half of your <span class="m">lead</span> figure which you have <span class="m">oiled</span>, and moisten it with <span class="m">spirits</span> as we have seen above, on your <span class="m">clay</span> base, then mold this half with a <span class="m">white plaster</span>. Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the <span class="m">plaster</span>, take your <span class="m">black wax</span> mixed with <span class="m">sulphur</span> as we have seen before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker. Dip it in hot <span class="m">urine</span>, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your half figure in <span class="m">lead</span>. And you will have a very neat hollow mold. Then adapt your <span class="m">wax</span> hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow <span class="m">wax</span>; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in <span class="m">wax</span> or <span class="m">metal</span> in a noyau. And the noyau mold will give you, whether in <span class="m">silver</span> or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the <span class="m">wax</span> one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other. And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it in the <span class="m">bleach</span>, if it is made of <span class="m">silver</span>, you can put into it some <span class="m">sugar</span> work

> Because you have molded one of your halves with <span class="m">plaster</span> and <span class="m">wax</span>, you can do the same thing to the other half.
