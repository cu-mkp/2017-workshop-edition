## The reach of an arquebuse

 
The proportion of a fowling piece is: 4 king's feet long and the <span class="m">bullet</span> weights xviii pennyweights, the expulsion vi pennyweight of <span class="m">powder</span>, its range iiii—by—xx pans and 3 and a half feet and two thumbs and around a line, which is the Paris aulne. The medium arquebuse, which is the usual one and the easiest, admits xv pennyweight of <span class="m">bullet</span>, v pennyweight of <span class="m">powder</span> & reaches lx paces.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Pewterer</span>

 
They mix viii <span class="ms">lb</span> <span class="add">or ten</span> of <span class="m">lead</span>, per <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">tin</span> in <span class="env">cities where they are <span class="pro">sworn masters</span></span>. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One also uses ii <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">looking glass tin</span> to bind it & three <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">debris</span>, that is to say the <span class="m">copper shards that <span class="pro">coppersmiths</span> make</span>. This makes the vessel more <span class="sn">sonorous</span> and it is not as breakable.

## Arquebuse

 
To keep it from backfiring, clean your arquebuse every eight days, and rub it with <span class="m">oil</span>, and when you draw out, wet some <span class="m">linen</span> in <span class="m">oil</span> & put it in instead of <span class="m">paper</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lake</span>

 
To test it, soak it & apply it to <span class="m">paper</span>, & if one or two <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span> later it does not die there, it is fine and good.
 
 
  

## Dyes from <span class="m">flowers</span>

 
<span class="m">Red poppies</span> that grow amongst wheat make a very beautiful columbine on white leather. The <span class="m">boufain</span> makes a very beautiful blue. An <span class="m">herb which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to flax, long and broad leaves like little bugloss, which has a violet flower verging on blue and looks like the fleur de lys,</span> makes a quite beautiful turquin, better than azure. Another <span class="m">columbine flower of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like that of the pansy</span>, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat in light earth.
