## Painter

 
The <span class="m">lake</span> & <span class="del"><span class="m">floree</span></span> <span class="m">rosette of <span class="pl">Ghent</span></span> & others lose their color & die in the air.
 
All <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> on which a <span class="tl">knife</span> can prick is worth nothing for grinding fine colors.
 
<span class="m">Chalk</span> has no body in <span class="m">oil</span>. <span class="m">Ceruse</span> is appropriate. But <span class="m">lead white</span> more excellent. <span class="m">Ceruse</span> is the whitest, when ground first in <span class="m">water</span>, the <span class="m">lead white</span> grayish. But <span class="del">the white</span> it takes on its perfect whiteness in <span class="m">oil</span>.
 
When you grind your colors, first clean your <span class="env">workshop</span> well, for when walking, if you stir up dust, this will damage your colors, which will never be beautiful if they are not very <span class="del">be</span> clean.
 
<span class="m">Florey</span> must not be mixed with <span class="m">azur d'esmail</span> or another, for it makes it green.
 
For <span class="tl">palettes</span> to paint, <span class="m">ivory</span> is excellent, <span class="m">knots of the <span class="pa">fir tree</span></span>, the <span class="m"><span class="pa">pear tree</span></span> &, if it is a <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut tree</span></span>, make sure the grain of the <span class="m">wood</span> runs lengthwise.
 
<span class="del">L</span> One always needs to prime <span class="del">d</span> on <span class="m">wood</span> to paint there in <span class="m">oil</span> in order to fill the holes & unevenness, and prime with some <span class="m">stil de grain yellow</span> & <span class="m">ceruse</span> mixed in <span class="m">oil</span>, then soften with a <span class="tl">feather</span>, which flattens better than a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>. Or when the primer is dry, scrape strongly with a <span class="tl">knife</span>.
 
To use <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span> in <span class="m">oil</span>, one needs to choose the most delicate. And to make it subtle, one ought not grind it, for this makes it whiten. But one needs to wash it, & the roughest going to the bottom, choose the one that is at the top of the <span class="m">water</span> or, by inclination, pour out the cloudy <span class="m">water</span>, then gather the <span class="m">azur</span>.

>   @<span class="pro">The one who <span class="add">makes his profession</span> working in <span class="m">oil</span></span> will hardly work well in <span class="m">distemper</span> if he has not been trained well from adolescence. For the way of working is different, because when washing the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> for <span class="m">distemper</span>, one always leaves it moist. And on the contrary, when one cleans the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> in <span class="m">oil</span> to soften, one wipes the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> well. Otherwise, the work would run & would soon be disfigured.

>   The <span class="pl">Italians</span> soften by hatching with a large flat <span class="tl">pinceau</span> which makes serrations.
 
> *at left middle margin*

> 
>   And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the <span class="pl">Flemish</span>, but make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker next & and finally a little blacker to better make recede & come up.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   In <span class="m">distemper</span> do not mix your different colors together <span class="del">But</span> for this makes them die, but use each separately. And in order that they do not dry & that you have time to soften, moisten the back of the <span class="m">canvas</span>.
