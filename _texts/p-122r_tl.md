## Fixing different animals

 
When you discover some twisted <span class="al">lizard</span>s which bite each other are the most difficult thing to mold because of the number of their feet and because of the tip of their tail which are very fine, steady the parts which are uncovered and which look like suspended in mid air, that way the second cast will not vary anything. If you need to steady the parts hanging in mid air, take a bit of <span class="m">wax</span>, rub it and elongate it on a <span class="tl">table</span>, make it big needle shaped, then cut the part you need with a hot <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wire</span> then join where it is necessary. Steady also the part which does not stick to the <span class="tl">mould</span> (when you uncover the half of the womb) with some <span class="m">wax</span> with the point of a <span class="tl">knife</span> @, joined and melted with the <span class="tl">wire</span>. When you cast, pour only to the spot and at the edge of the <span class="m">wax</span> which being attached to the animal will melt but still lead the cast towards it without damaging anything. This is a secret.

One can arrange embracing <span class="al">snake</span>s, but only small ones.

 
  

## Flower in the mouth of a <span class="al">snake</span>

 
If you want to put a flower in the mouth of a <span class="al">snake</span> or a branch of a herb which guards against its bite, take the best arranged little branch you can find, and display its stalk into its mouth. Then put <span class="ms">two little pieces of <span class="m">wax</span></span> around the stalk of the herb. Melt a bit of <span class="m">wax</span> with the point of a warm <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wire</span>, while you are closing the jaws of the animal with your <span class="bp">hand</span>. And then you can cut the head to make it burn with the flower. If the herb is strong enough, it will stay in the same position by itself but if the flower is light, like <span class="pa">wormwood</span>, which droops, the dampness of the sand will lift it up, make it swim and stand by itself, without any support, as well as if you had put some <span class="m">thread</span> under it passing through with a <span class="tl">needle</span>.
