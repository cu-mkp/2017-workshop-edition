Next take the said <span class="m">benzoin just as roughly crushed</span>, and put it to use with the aforesaid <span class="m">water</span> and let it rest for the space of one & half <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>, & then take the said <span class="m">water</span> & put it into another <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> vial</span> & soak it very well. And on the rest of the said <span class="m">benzoin</span> that remains at the bottom of the said first <span class="tl">vial</span>, put the rest of the <span class="m">water</span> over this and do as before when you see that the case is going well, and mix the first <span class="m">water</span> with the second. By means of this you will be able to help yourself to this for something more noble.
