## Enema

 
 In order that the tube does not harm, for example children, or those who have protruding or swollen hemorrhoidal veins, one covers the end of the tube with a piece of <span class="m">chicken gut</span> & one folds it back over the end, & in this way, one gives the enema.
 
 
  

## Cast

 
 <span class="m">Tin</span> retracts once thick, thusly it is best to cast it thin & to make two pieces out of one, then <span class="m">solder</span> <span class="add">them</span> if needs be. One uses a strong piece of <span class="m">taffeta</span> to sieve the fine sand, with which one first covers the medal, the <span class="ms">thickness of a <span class="cn">teston</span></span>.
 
 
  

## For making colors run

 
 Mix <span class="m">vinegar</span> <span class="del">with</span> a little with <span class="m">bile</span>, & put it <span class="del">p</span> into a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> bottle</span>, & if you want to keep it for a long time, add some <span class="m">salt</span> to it & of this mix some of it among your colors & that will make them run.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Earwax</span>

 
 If you take enough with the tip of an ear picker & you sieve it with foam of <span class="m">urine</span>, which often forms in <span class="sup">the <span class="m">urine</span></span> of those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Enamels</span>

 
 For recognizing well their difference and their true color by <span class="tl">candle</span>, you need to put your <span class="tl">candle</span> behind a <span class="tl"><span class="m">crystal</span> mirror</span>, or a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> globe or jar</span> full of <span class="m">water</span>, because this light is like <span class="env">sunlight</span>.
