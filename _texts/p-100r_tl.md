## Gold color

 
To quickly make a layer of <span class="m">or <span class="del">sur</span> mat</span> on <span class="m">canvas</span> or other <span class="m">oil panel</span>, one makes fatty <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> <span class="env">in the sun</span> or <span class="env">on the fire</span>, as said above, for it thickens by itself in this way, although there is neither <span class="m">lead</span>, nor <span class="m">ceruse</span>. And with this, grind <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">mine</span>, & other desiccatives, not <span class="m">verdet</span> nor <span class="m">orpiment</span>, for they cause the <span class="m">gold</span> to die. It will be dry soon. However, if the <span class="env"><span class="tmp">weather is not clear & dry</span></span>, do not shade it, for if the <span class="env"><span class="tmp">weather is damp & humid</span></span>, it would turn black.
 
 
  

## Portrait—painting from nature

 
One needs to carefully <span class="sn">observe</span> the eyes, the nose, & the beard, for these three things make strong resemblance.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gemstones</span>

 
One needs to pound your materials in a thick <span class="m">glass</span> <span class="tl">mortar</span> coated with <span class="m">mastic</span>, & encased & into another <span class="m">wooden</span> <span class="tl">mortar</span>, so that it does not break, this can be useful to <span class="pro">perfumers</span>, & <span class="del">la t</span> use a <span class="m">glass</span> <span class="tl">pestle</span> too.

** <span class="m">Glass</span> <span class="tl">mortar</span> and <span class="tl">table</span> for crushing. **

 
 
  

## Vitrified <span class="m">saltpeter</span>

 
 Melted with <span class="m">pebbles</span>, it makes the <span class="m">glass</span> very white. But rather, it needs to be calcined on a hot tile or <span class="tl">paddle</span>. And mix the liquid remains of the vapor with as much white, calcined <span class="m">pebbles</span>. It is true that, in the little <span class="tl">oven</span>, it does not make it very clear. But for big windows, it makes the <span class="m">glass</span> very clear, & white & clean.
 
 
  

## Windows through which the <span class="env">sun</span> will not pass

 
Take the aforementioned <span class="m">calcined saltpeter</span> & expose it to a <span class="env">humid air or place</span>, and it will convert itself into a liquid which, if rubbed <span class="add">on both sides</span> of the windows, the <span class="env">sun</span> will not pass through; rather, it will give shade. One needs to put the <span class="m">saltpeter</span> on some clean <span class="del">thing</span> <span class="add">place</span>, & <span class="del">it</span> put <span class="tl">glowing coals</span> on it, and continue all over until it no longer burns.
