becomes porous. Most importantly, make that the cast is always higher than the molded thing, because usually the sand, being reheated, swells <span class="del">& if the</span> <span class="del">par ce</span> in the middle, & in this way, the molded thing remaining higher than the cast, the <span class="m">metal</span> cannot run into it easily or enter at all. Also make sure that the <span class="tl">mold</span> & the cast are well reheated. Cast also all at once & <span class="env">out of the wind</span>. And if your medal is really thin, put a <span class="tl"><span class="m">card</span></span>, or two or three <span class="ms">thicknesses of <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span></span>, underneath, when you want to mold it. In this way the <span class="tl">mold</span> will be lower than the cast. Cast also at the place where your medal will be <span class="del">plus es</span> the least thick & where there will be less relief.
 
 
  

## Excellent sand for <span class="m">lead</span>, <span class="m">tin</span> and <span class="m">copper</span>

Since then, I molded with <span class="m">burned bone</span>, <span class="m">iron dross</span> & <span class="m">burned felt</span>, very pulverised & ground finely on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> and well mixed together. I moistened them very well with <span class="m">beaten egg glair</span>. And having covered the medal with it, as in the others, then filled the <span class="tl">frame</span> with <span class="m">sand from the <span class="env">mine</span></span>, I knocked moderately. I found it to be of very good release & molded very neatly. I let it sit all <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">night</span></span> long. The <span class="tmp">next morning</span>, I reheated it little by little, over the course of seven or eight <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span> (for if possible, no humidity ought to remain in the <span class="tl">frame</span>). I cast twice in <span class="m">copper</span> alloyed with <span class="m">☾</span>, as old <span class="m">K</span>. The substance came very beautiful, shiny, & <span class="sn">sonorous</span>, & without a chappe, and my sand was not corrupted at all. Since then, I have cast with it several casts of <span class="m">soft lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>, that came out better & more neatly than any other that I have ever found.
 
When you mold, make certain lines around your <span class="tl">mold</span>, in the <span class="tl">frame</span>, in order to attract the substance to all sides, in this way.

<span class="m">Potin from seringue</span> & other <span class="del">co</span>works, runs even better than <span class="m">fine latten</span>. But I think that it is better <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">copper</span> & <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">latten</span>, which have been used & have been in very thin works, such as skillets & other similar things. I have this mixture of <span class="ms">half</span> and <span class="ms">half</span> come out well.
