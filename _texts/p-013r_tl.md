 <span class="m">agate</span> of various color. But because this total whiteness did not respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in a <span class="m">brick</span> of the exact size of the thing & put it inside. Then I reddened two <span class="tl"><span class="pro">glassmaker</span>'s solders</span>, & as they were red, I presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I got the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">diamond</span> point</span>, and I polished it with <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="al">hog</span> bristles</span></span> and <span class="tl"><span class="m">tripoli</span></span>. I do not know if it would be better to reheat it under hot <span class="m">ashes</span>, & if it would be good to encase it in <span class="m">alabaster</span>, which is very cold, as I encased it in the <span class="m">brick</span>.
 
 
  

## Carnation from <span class="m">arsenic</span>

 
<span class="m">Sublimated arsenic</span>, that is to say, the white one that is sold as <span class="m">stone</span>, when ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, mixed with <span class="m">vermilion</span> or <span class="m">lake</span> or <span class="m">minium</span>, makes a beautiful flesh color that is always shiny. <span class="m">Yellow arsenic</span> has a very beautiful color, the white one is good in <span class="m">oil</span> and agrees well with the <span class="m">lake</span>.
 
 
  

## To dye

 
Mix <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> & <span class="m">vitriol</span> & boil them together. Then mix in <span class="m">lake</span> or <span class="m">verdet</span> & <span class="m">azure</span> or similar, & dye. This will not come off unless the <span class="al">animal</span> sheds. @Non bona.
 
 
  

## Polishing of <span class="m">stones</span>

 
Engraved <span class="m">stones</span> are not polished on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> wheel</span>, but with <span class="tl">brushes</span> and <span class="m">tripoli</span>. Yet faceted and flat stones are polished on the said <span class="tl">wheel</span>.
 
 
  

## Fine <span class="tl">sieves</span> of raw <span class="m">silk</span>

 
One makes tammy of raw <span class="m">silk</span> on a weaver, to make very fine and delicate <span class="tl">sieves</span>. And for that effect, you must not choose raw <span class="m">silk</span> whitened by <span class="m">sulfur</span> smoke: this renders the <span class="m">silk</span> charged with a sticky vapor that would hold the flour and in the end would prevent it from
