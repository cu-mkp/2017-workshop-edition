## Impromptu mask

 
Mold some <span class="m">paper</span> & put it on the face of somebody who is making an ugly grimace. Let it dry & take your pattern to paint from it
 
 # & swellings. It is necessary that it not be too wet for the above said reasons. Reheat little <span class="add">by little</span>. And if, after having been molded, you leave it to dry slowly, in some <span class="env">dry place</span>, & not over a big fire, it would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it swells. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the <span class="tl">furnace</span>, <span class="tmp">after you have taken the bread out</span>, would be well proper. One ought not complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself hard as <span class="m">marble</span> & you can polish it & the <span class="tl">mold</span> cannot be spoiled. Having been used, crush & <span class="tl">sieve</span> again, yet without being so scrupulous as to render it very fine, <span class="del">I</span> for once passed only through a <span class="tl">common sieve</span>, it has more force <span class="del">than</span> and releases better, than when it is so fine.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Eau magistra</span>

 
Dissolve <span class="m">rock salt</span> or <span class="del"><span class="m">salt</span></span> finely pulverized <span class="m">sandever</span> & put on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> in a <span class="env">cellar</span>, & it will dry out by reheating the <span class="tl">mold</span>, & will give it a bond to withstand several castings. Try to moisten it with <span class="m">tartar oil</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Flour</span>

 
Ground during <span class="tmp">Advent</span>, keeps for the <span class="tmp">whole year</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand from a <span class="env">mine in <span class="pl">Thoulouse</span></span></span>

 
The <span class="m">sand from <span class="pl">Thoulouse</span></span>, which is taken, from the <span class="env">depths of the earth, from the small hill of <span class="pl">Puy David</span></span>, is excellent in itself, but to make it withstand several castings, I mix it with <span class="m">pulverized sandever</span> & moistened, which hardens it, & takes body & bond with it, & makes it withstand <span class="del">more than five</span> as many castings as you wish. Try to moisten the <span class="m">crushed glass</span> and other <span class="del">e</span> sands with the <span class="m">waters of the above mentioned salts</span>. It wants to be, like all <span class="m">natural sand</span>, well reheated before putting it to work. One pulverises it, because it is in a lump, then one reheats it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> kettle</span> or similar thing, until it no longer smokes.

>   It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one ought to refresh it with new sand.
