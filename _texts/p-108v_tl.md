thus one mixes it & reducing it into <span class="del">p</span><span class="m"><span class="add">b</span> small stones</span>, purging it of its impurities. Then one puts it to cook neatly in a <span class="del"><span class="tl">pot</span></span> <span class="add"><span class="tl">earthen vessel</span></span> in the <span class="tl">furnace of <span class="pro">those who make <span class="tl">pots</span></span></span>, and one leaves it there until the <span class="tl">pots</span> are cooked. Next, one mixes it again with <span class="m">essence of sal ammoniac</span> & one grinds it very well, and one empties the <span class="m">muddy & clean water</span> in a separate <span class="tl">vessel</span>. Again, one puts the same <span class="m">essence</span> on top & one grinds & again one puts the <span class="m">muddy water</span> with the other. And one does thusly, until it has passed everything. In this way, one purges & purifies it, & one renders it very fine & handleable. Having taken away the <span class="m">water</span>, by tilting it or with a <span class="tl">sponge</span>, one takes the residue and one dries it. Then, moistening it with the above mentionned <span class="m">water</span>, like one does with the other <span class="del"><span class="m">eau</span></span> sand, one uses it in <span class="tl">chassis</span>, where, if it retracts, it is a sign that it has not reheated enough & that one needs to reheat it further. This one is appropriate for molding all <span class="m">metals</span>, and especially <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span>, and the more it is used the better it is. One needs to set aside the one in which you cast <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>, for it would sour the <span class="m">gold</span> you would cast.
 
<span class="m">Alum de plume</span> should be reheated in a <span class="del"><span class="tl">chaulderon</span></span> <span class="add"><span class="tl">crucible</span> covered with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">tile</span></span></span> in a strong <span class="del">flamme</span> <span class="add">charcoal</span> fire, so that the impurities, which could be there, burns with it which does not burn. This is done either in the <span class="tl"><span class="pro">goldsmith</span>’s forge</span>, <span class="tl">surrounded with <span class="m">bricks</span></span>, or in a <span class="tl">fourneau à vent</span> with foeu de fusion, so that the <span class="del">sable demeure <span class="tmp">asses long temps</span></span> <span class="add"><span class="tl">crucible</span> remains red for a <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">quarter hour</span></span></span>. This is done more to purify it than for anything else. It becomes reddish on the surface & on the inside it remains white & better dried out #

>   # After your <span class="m">alum de plume</span> is cooled, pestle it in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>, then grind it on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, and it will be rendered in very fine wooly filaments, which gives binding to the sand, without getting burned as other things do, which is a fine invention. Pestle it in the <span class="tl">mortar</span>, by dragging the <span class="tl">pestle</span>, for the flying dust could enter your <span class="bp">throat</span> or land on your <span class="bp">face</span>, which will give you reason <span class="sn">to scratch yourself well</span>. Put a little every time in the <span class="tl">mortar</span>, to avoid the flying dust. It is better to grind it thusly, in the <span class="tl">mortar</span>, dragging the <span class="tl">pestle</span>, than on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, <span class="del">car</span> where <span class="del">c</span> it spreads & in the <span class="tl">mortar</span>, it collects on all sides. Render it very fine & <span class="sn">soft to the touch</span>.
 
<span class="m">Clay</span>,to make circles around <span class="tl">molds</span>, should be very fat & handleable, and serves only to make the surrounding of the <span class="tl">molds</span>. Thus, one needs only choose it well fat, and beat very well & moisten it moderately with some <span class="m">water</span> & keep it in a <span class="tl">pit</span> or in a <span class="tl">terrine</span> and make numerous holes with a <span class="tl">stick</span> in it, which fill with <span class="m">water</span>, in order to keep always fresh & soft, so that it is always ready to use when needed.
