## <span class="pro">Glazier</span>s’ <span class="m">black</span>

 
<span class="m">Iron scale</span> taken from bars that have been in the fire for a <span class="tmp">long time</span>, & which is thick, is much better than <span class="m">the common delicate kind that falls under the anvil</span> in the <span class="tl">forge</span>, because it imitates <span class="m">niello</span>. To said <span class="m">black</span>, described elsewhere, some add <span class="del">d</span> a little <span class="m">minium</span> to it. 
 
 
  

## Sheared <span class="al">ewes</span>

 
If the <span class="pro">shearer</span> wounds them at some point, he applies the very excrement of the ewe on it. When they are fat, they are easier to shear and do not get hurt as easily.

>   If the <span class="pro">shearer</span> wants to 'viscorter' them, that is to castrate them as <span class="x">they</span> are one or two years old, he must not have been with his wife, because this would cause the <span class="al">sheep</span> to die. 
 
 
  

## Colors and <span class="m">gilding</span> on <span class="m">glass</span>

 
One ought not to give as strong <span class="m">gum water</span> on <span class="m">glass</span> for the <span class="del"><span class="m">gold</span> layer as for</span> <span class="m">silver</span> layer as for the <span class="m">gold</span> layer because a <span class="m">silver</span> leaf is twice as strong as a <span class="m">gold</span> leaf. Also, <span class="m">silver</span> is harder and therefore does not scratch as easily. <span class="del">Q</span> And if the <span class="m">gum</span> was not a little strong for the <span class="m">silver</span>, the latter would not crack so neatly. When you work, <span class="del">the humid</span> the exhalation of your <span class="bp">breath</span> moistens the leaf layered on the <span class="m">glass</span>, & therefore it would be good, while working, to heat it up a few times. You need to be very careful to wash that which you want to be blank & serve as a background for painting with colors, for if it were not quite clean of the <span class="m">gum</span>'s greasiness & viscosity, <span class="del">the</span> & of other things, the colors would not be so brisk on it. To advance your works, you can ponce, or, better still, layer the <span class="m">gum</span> & leaf on a cut <span class="m">paper</span>. In this way, you will need to repair very little. If you want to make <span class="m">gold</span> color there without <span class="m">gold</span>, mix soaked dried <span class="m">saffron</span> with a little <span class="m">massicot</span>.
