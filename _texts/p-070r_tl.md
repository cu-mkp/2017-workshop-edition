When you have molded, it is good to reheat your mold on the smoke of the substance you are melting, because the cast absorbs the quality o<span class="del">e</span><span class="add">f</span> the <span class="m">metal</span>, which runs afterwards more easily in something that comes from it.
 
 <span class="m"><span class="al">Human</span> bones</span> are the best for casting once calcined.
 
To cast neatly, it is necessary that your substance be quite hot & to achieve this, when your substance is melted, throw in some <span class="m">iron scales</span>, or in powder or otherwise <span class="del">E</span>, for it heats <span class="m">copper</span> a lot & cleanses it of its <span class="m">fat</span>. At the end, when you want to cast, add some <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, by folding your additions in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> so that others not know what you are adding.
 
<span class="m"><span class="al">Sheep</span> foot bones</span> are even better than <span class="m"><span class="al">ox</span> foot bones</span>.
 
<span class="m">Oil</span> & <span class="m">tallow</span> make it really porous & <span class="m">crushed glass</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> alone.
 
<span class="m">Cendrée earth</span> molds very neatly.
 
<span class="m">Ashes</span> do not have enough body to withstand <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
It is best not to mix the sands, but fill the <span class="tl">box mold</span> with one only.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> is always fat, & does not mold neatly. One finds that it comes out better alloyed with a <span class="ms">quarter</span> of <span class="m">copper</span>, but it needs to be cast very hot.
 
<span class="m">Copper</span> comes out well with a bit of <span class="m">metal</span>. If you mix in <span class="m">metal</span> within <span class="m">latten</span>, it will be more brittle & more troublesome.
 
A slightly coarser sand has more body.
 
<span class="m">Sand from <span class="del">corp</span> rock</span> is always better, which seems like <span class="m">tuf</span> in lumps, which has a beautiful & very fine grain, & a little fat. One crushes it, then one dries it in a <span class="tl">skillet</span> on the fire, until it <span class="del">is</span> stops smoking, then one passes it through through a <span class="tl">double sieve</span> & fine, & one molds with it.

>   Some wanting to cast large works in <span class="m">latten</span> <span class="del">y</span> mix in the sand some <span class="m">crushed glass</span> to give the <span class="m">earth</span> some bond. But it makes it porous, and needs to be repaired.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   One puts in <span class="m">lead</span> for a large work to make it run, but not <span class="del">not<br/> for</span> in a small one because it would leave <span class="m">filth</span> all around the work.
