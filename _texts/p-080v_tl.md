## <span class="pro">Founders of small works <span class="add">@ in <span class="m">tin</span></span></span>

 
They usually cast with <span class="m">solder</span>, even the things that should not become empty, for the latter require <span class="m">fine & soft tin</span>, which however would not release, & would not become empty if it was mixed or had some <span class="m">looking glass tin</span> <span class="del">mix</span> <span class="add">in</span> it, just like they put in a little of it in <span class="m">soft tin</span>. They carve their works on <span class="m">stones of which are made the sharpening stones or files of <span class="pro">barbers</span></span>, which are found in <span class="env">great flakes towards the mountains</span>, & resemble <span class="m">slate</span>. They are three colors of them: reddish, which is not as perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire <span class="del">& as</span>,one <span class="del">dard</span> of the color of dark <span class="m">slate</span>, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they imprint it on <span class="tl"><span class="m">carton</span></span>, as thick as one <span class="ms"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>, <span class="add">to serve as a pattern</span>, then with a little <span class="tl">compass</span> & little matching <span class="m">iron fittings</span>, they carve their figures, having first flattened their <span class="m">stones</span> & worn down one against the other, they make their <span class="del">p</span> molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins perfectly, because the <span class="m">stones</span> render themselves even. Before casting, they rub the mould with <span class="m">tallow</span>, which has quickly absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking <span class="m">fine powder of quicklime</span> in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span></span>, they rub the mould while beating with the <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span></span> on top, then blow a little on top to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents. If the work is big and they make it in such a way as seen here, they pierce a hole in the part of the medal, that is least visible. And with a <span class="tl">gimblet</span> they pierce the mold on the side of the medal.

 And if they want their work to stay pierced in whichever place, they drive in <span class="tl">a piece of <span class="m">cork</span></span> at this place in the <span class="tl">mold</span>. And the <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> will not attach to it.

>   Make sure the <span class="tl">pegs</span> of your <span class="tl">box mold</span> enter easily so that <span class="del">opening</span> it will easily open without shifting anything; and that your <span class="tl">box molds</span> fit well together; & the <span class="tl">table is very flat</span>.
