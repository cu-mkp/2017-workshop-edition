## Casting with <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>

 
 To cast <span class="m">silver</span> and <span class="m">gold</span> do always put a little ground stone of <span class="m">borax</span> on the bottom of the crucible, and put your matter on it. That way the acid <span class="m">smoke</span> won't corrupt these two matters, but it is especially efficient for <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
 If you have several molds to cast, do not fill them all in one cast, because <span class="m">metal</span> would get cold. Cast one after another.
 
 When your mold start being red inside, look at the cast, if you do not see any black spot keep the same heat, and if needed, add a few half lighted <span class="m">charcoals</span> with the help of pliers. However, put ground <span class="m">borax</span> at the bottom of the crucible, and put <span class="m">silver</span> on the top of this matter, then put your crucible into the forge, reheat your crucible which is between lighted <span class="m">charcoals</span>, until it becomes red; do not blow before that. When you'll use the bellows, make continuous longitudinal moves, tug a little bit the bellows, push and pull, that way the heat will become greater. From time to time remove your crucible out of the top of the forge with the help of your warm pliers, because if your crucible is close to the tuyere <span class="m">silver</span> would cool down rather than heat up. That why it is better to put the lighted <span class="m">charcoals</span> above the tuelle, three fingers far from the wall of the forge. That way the crucible is heating much better. When your <span class="m">silver</span> starts melting, if you find that it is too acid by noticing that the lumps are cracking and bursting, take the size of a walnut of <span class="m">arsenic</span>, and twice as much of <span class="m">crude tartar</span> which is coarsely ground, that way it will heat better. Pour some of this mixture on <span class="m">silver</span> in the crucible, it will get clearer. But if you have some of that sublimate crust on the <span class="m">metallic matter</span>, and which looks like grains of <span class="m">steel</span>, # put some of this matter in your melted <span class="m">silver</span>.

>   Small molds can be reheated soon. But you should oven—dry large and small molds because dampness go out of the mold with the heat. The intense heat of <span class="m">charcoals</span> drives the heat from within outside.
