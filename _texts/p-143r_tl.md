## Moulding <span class="al">turtles</span> and <span class="al">tortoises</span>

 
The <span class="al">turtle</span> <span class="sup">the one that lives in water</span> is more beautiful to mold because it has prettier scales and straight legs. And the <span class="al">tortoises</span> have crooked ones. They eat a lot. To get ready to kill them, open their mouth and pass a long penknife through all the intestines. And then make it swallow some <span class="m">vinegar</span> mixed with <span class="m">spirits</span> or <span class="m">urine</span>, as one does for snakes. It is necessary to mould them in several pieces, and even the back sometimes because the sides of certain ones are narrower than others and in this instance do not release <span class="sup">from the cast</span>. To make them die, you must not boil them, because they come apart, even the shell, in the hot <span class="m">water</span>. They <span class="sup">the shells</span> come out better <span class="sup">when</span> hollowed because their great thickness spoils the mold. <span class="al">Turtles</span> are more lively. The <span class="al">tortoises</span> are leaner, slower, and more sleepy. If you scratch <span class="al">turtles</span> on their shells, no matter how sleepy they are, they move; <span class="al">tortoises</span> do not.

## <span class="pro">Moulders</span> from <span class="pl">Foix</span>

 
Those who mould from across <span class="sup">the way</span> make their sand from <span class="m">crocum</span> ferri and <span class="m">calcinated slate</span>, but <span class="m">slate</span> always retains its bumpiness and swells because it is a fatty. In the noyau, it is not good; in sand, it can be put to use. They <span class="sup">the moulders from <span class="pl">Foix</span></span> sieve their sand, grind it on <span class="m">porphyry</span>, and soak it in <span class="m">water</span>, and they keep the finest bits which are on the top, then they reheat it.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Toad</span>

 
Having been molded, you can take it out it without burning it, because it releases <span class="sup">easily</span>from the mold. Choose the biggest and the lumpiest <span class="sup"><span class="al">toads</span></span>. Because they contain a lot of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better. You could make your cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome to cut. It is best to do it in three or 4 parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that is close to the cast/mold. Make as well some casting conduits all the way from the end <span class="sup">of the cast</span>.

 Let the mold cool rather than opening it, even for thick things.
