 For a <span class="tl">furnace</span> for melting a large quantity of <span class="m">metal</span>
 
 
  

## Curing dogs from mange

 
Give them a pill of precipitate, that is to say 3, 4, or up to 5 <span class="m">grains</span>, mixed with their <span class="m">food</span>. Having given them one for one week, give them another seven or eight days later.
 
 
  

## Excellent <span class="m">mustard</span>

 
Dry some <span class="m">bread</span> in an oven, then stick <span class="m">cloves</span> & <span class="m">cinnamon</span> into it and put it to soak in good <span class="m">wine</span>. Then, being well crushed, pass everything through a <span class="m">cloth</span> strainer and incorporate it with your <span class="m">mustard seeds</span>.
 
 
  

## Keeping birds and animals

 
Take a measurement from <span class="x">the part of</span> their body that is fleshy and more susceptible to decay, with some <span class="m">canvas</span> that you shall cut according to their size and width. Having filled this with <span class="m">cotton</span> and stitched it, skin them. But leave the head, neck, wings and feet of birds, and head, legs, feet and tail of animals, because those dry easily. Then use that <span class="m">skin</span> to dress the mold made of <span class="m">canvas</span>. Small ones can be dried in an oven or covered in <span class="m">sel ammoniac</span> and <span class="m">(?)</span>.
