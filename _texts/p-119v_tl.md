## Way to rework spat

 
You find an earth in <span class="pl">Germany</span>, the color of cooked plaster, but have long and soft filaments which are easy to handle. Because it is mixed with earth and rubbish, one pounds it roughly and forms little balls having soaked it previously in <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> <span class="m">water</span>, following the above indication. Reheat these balls in a <span class="pro">potter</span>'s furnace. And then soak them in the same <span class="m">water</span> again. Earth and filth will remain at the bottom, and pure <span class="m">aspalt</span>, which is light, soft and malleable as soaked <span class="m">flour</span>, sticks to <span class="m">water</span> and rises to the surface, making the <span class="m">water</span> cloudy. Pour this cloudy <span class="m">water</span> in another pot. Letting it rests, one empties the <span class="m">water</span> tilting the pot or taking the <span class="m">water</span> out using a sponge. And the pure<span class="m">aspalt</span> remains at the bottom. Dry it and use it in frame, having moistened it with <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> <span class="m">water</span> Then soak it into <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> <span class="m">water</span>, and use it for frames in which it shrinks when reheated or dried, that is to say that one needs to reheat it again on a good fire and reddens it, as for example for medals and flat things. Use this one, because it is the best of all for <span class="m">gold</span>, <span class="m">silver</span>, <span class="m">copper</span>, <span class="m">lead</span>, <span class="m">latten</span>, and <span class="m">tin</span>. Because it withstands fire and reddens whenever you need, without deteriorating. The more you use it the better it is, and does not change. In the beginning it is white, and while using it turns grey. However make sure to put aside the one that served for casting <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span> and <span class="m">latten</span>, because <span class="m">gold</span> would get brittle, and would not come out well. And even better, you will put some of this aside to use it for each metal.

## Excellent secret to mould in hollow and very delicately in fine <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Cast your animal or <span class="al">lizard</span> or other thing with the above mentioned sand, with alloyed <span class="m">silver</span> and it will come out very neat. But make sure to mould it hollow, or at least leave a small hole in it or in another place. Then gild your animal with fine <span class="m">gold</span>, as much homogeneously as possible, three, four or five times, until your <span class="m">gold</span> becomes as thick as a piece of <span class="m">paper</span> or anything similar. And the scales will always come out evenly. Then dip your cast into good <span class="m">aqua fortis</span>, which will corrode the alloyed <span class="m">silver</span> through the hole, and <span class="m">gold</span> will remain hollow, light and wonderful.
