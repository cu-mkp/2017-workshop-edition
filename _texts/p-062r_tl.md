## Perspectives

 
Perspectives in <span class="m">oil</span> <span class="tmp">take a long time</span> because of several lines that need to be done with a <span class="tl">ruler</span>, and for this reason one usually does them in <span class="m">distemper</span>. One takes the points <span class="add">at</span> one’s discretion. The main thing in having the knowledge of the point. One usually makes two or three of them, sometimes five.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Ochre</span>

 
It is put for faces, hair, skulls and rocks.
 
 
  

## Distant people and animals

 
One first does them roughly in gray or in purple, which is made of <span class="m">cendre d’azur</span> & <span class="m">lake</span>. Once dry, one highlights & finishes with flesh tones & other colors & white. And it looks better & is sooner done than in white & black. Armies<span class="ill"></span> are painted thus.
 
 
  

## Drawing

 
After you have primed your panel & scraped with a <span class="tl">knife</span> to render it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest piece of <span class="tl"><span class="m">charcoal</span></span> you can find, for with a short one you would not see your line so well & would do it more roughly. Let the tip of the <span class="tl"><span class="m">charcoal</span></span> be thin, & in order not to render it dull & blunt soon, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly sharpen it. Also, hold your <span class="tl"><span class="m">charcoal</span></span> as far at the end as you can, <span class="del">& do it</span> & accustom yourself <span class="del">af</span> make a light line. For if you accustom yourself to drawing delicately with <span class="tl"><span class="m">charcoal</span></span>, you will do likewise with colors. And he who is rough with <span class="tl"><span class="m">charcoal</span></span> is never excellent with colors. And by a line of <span class="m">charcoal</span>, <span class="pro">masters</span> pass judgement on their <span class="pro">apprentices</span>. First make the outline of your drawing, that is the contour, lightly & without any too scrupulous work, but boldly. In so doing, you will teach yourself to be an <span class="pro">artist</span>, and if you need to to undo anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Next re—work all the distinctive lines, & do not keep too close to your panel, but occasionally step away from it to better judge the proportions. Once the first drawing seems good to you, retrace all the lines with the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> in rose color or another color in <span class="m">gum</span> or <span class="m">distemper</span>. Thus you will work more confidently with colors, and with less <span class="add">effort</span>.
