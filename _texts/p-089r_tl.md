## <span class="m">Sand of burnt <span class="al">oxen</span> bone and rock salt</span>

 
I pulverised them separately & finely ground them on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, as much as I could. Then I mixed <span class="ms">as much of one as the other</span> & reworked them on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>. Next I moistened it in <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span>, folded in a wet <span class="tl">napkin</span>, which is made faster than in the <span class="env"><span class="tmp">serain of the night</span></span> or in the <span class="env">moisture of the cellar</span>. And I have not found anything else which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid. And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out very neatly in <span class="m">soft tin</span>, like the first one, and withstood several casts. For <span class="m">tin</span>, I believe that it is not necessary to seek a better one, nor for <span class="m">fine lead</span> also, which comes out almost as neatly as <span class="m">tin</span>. <span class="del">Tou</span> the <span class="m">bone of the foot of <span class="al">oxen</span></span> is always so lean on its own that, without being mixed with one or two parts of some <span class="m">fat sand</span> &having bond such as <span class="m">tripoli</span>, <span class="m">salts</span>, <span class="m">felt</span>, <span class="m">ashes</span> & similar things, it would not release, & would not mold neatly for it crumbles.
 
 
  

## Reheating or drying a molded <span class="tl">frame</span>

 
Always put the most delicate part, such as the face, above, so that nothing falls in it that could hinder your fusion.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Natural sand</span>

 
It does not want to be reheated for <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>, <span class="del">m</span> and is better very new & fresh.
