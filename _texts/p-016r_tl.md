## Melting <span class="m">soft iron</span>

 
It is a common opinion that once <span class="m">iron</span> has been melted, it cannot be remelted because they only heat it in small <span class="tl">forge</span>s, in which it only catches fire. <span class="pro">Alchemists</span> are confident they can melt it with <span class="m">realgar</span>, <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">orpiment</span>. But without all that, some have found a way to melt not only brittle <span class="m">iron</span>, like that used for <span class="m">iron</span> pots, but also soft <span class="m">iron</span> such as pig or ingot <span class="m">iron</span>, which are the most difficult ones <span class="x">to work with</span>. For this result they make a <span class="tl">furnace</span> that is one <span class="ms">pan</span> and a half wide and two <span class="ms">pan</span>s deep, and the tuelle, which is the barrel marked A where the <span class="tl">bellows' pipes</span> fit, has to be placed midway through the depth of the furnace so that there is one <span class="ms">pan</span> of the <span class="tl">furnace</span> opening on the tuelle and one <span class="ms">pan</span> under it.

>   The <span class="pro"><span class="m">iron</span> smiths</span>, to make the <span class="m">iron</span> run, at the opening of the <span class="tl">forge</span>, place two or three handfuls of <span class="m"><span class="pa">wallwort</span></span> <span class="sup">in the direction</span> they want to make the <span class="m">cast iron</span> run, and that makes the <span class="m">iron</span> wonderfully ductile and flowy.
 
It is necessary that the tuelle is inserted <span class="sup">through</span> to the middle of the <span class="tl">furnace</span> opening, which is a main clue for the secret because the wind will hit the edge and the wall, which makes up the center of the <span class="tl">furnace</span> and in that manner, it spreads equally everywhere, as well as above, like flames in a reverberatory oven, and thus heats much more; because if the <span class="env">wind</span> hits the melted or ready to be melted matter perpendicularly, it would cool it down and it would stop it from running and melting. It is also necessary for the <span class="tl">bellows</span> to be activated by jumps and by the <span class="m">water</span> stream as <span class="sup">happens</span> at <span class="tl">forges</span>, because in this way, <span class="tl">bellows</span> are activated with great precision and great speed, which the strength of <span class="pro">workers</span> could not duplicate. As you can see, the wall is thus raised up and the <span class="tl">furnace</span> <span class="sup">is laid</span> on the ground, at the edge of which you dig a pit, like at other <span class="tl">forges</span>. In order to put the moulds you want to cast inside, and for this purpose, you unstop the opening that you made at the bottom of the <span class="tl">furnace</span> to allow the melted matter to flow. You will be able to melt two <span class="ms">quintals</span> of <span class="m">iron</span> each time and, in order to do this, you will choose the biggest <span class="m">charcoal</span> you will find and put a measure of it at the bottom on the surface area of the furnace and pile up from the bottom to the top of the wall, in the shape of <span class="sup">an upside down V</span>.

>   Some make a mould of the same size as the piece, then immerse it, then beat a soft <span class="m">iron</span> piece cut to size, and when this bit is red hot, they beat it into the mould and round it out with a large <span class="tl">file</span>. These bullets are thought to be stronger than the melted ones which, being made of hard <span class="m">iron</span>, are more prone to break.
