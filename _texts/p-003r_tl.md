## <span class="m">Counterfeit coral</span>

 \+ 
One needs to first make the branches of <span class="m">wood</span> or take a bizarre <span class="m">thorn branch</span>, then melt a <span class="ms">lb</span> of the most beautiful<span class="m">clear pitch resin</span> and put in one <span class="ms">ounce</span> of <span class="m">subtly ground vermilion</span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span>, and if you add in a little <span class="m"><span class="pl">Venice</span> lake platte</span>, the color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the <span class="m">resin</span> melted over a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire and not of flame, for fear that the fire catches within. Next dip in your branches while turning, & if there should remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the <span class="m">charcoal</span>.

>   <span class="m">Colophony</span> is nothing other than <span class="m">resin</span> cooked again. To do it well, take a <span class="tl"><span class="m">leaded</span> pot</span> & melt the <span class="m">resin</span>, & boil it over the <span class="tl">brazier</span> a good <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span>, & until it appears not to be thick, but clear & liquid like <span class="m">water</span> & it easily runs & flows from the tip of a <span class="tl">stick</span> with which you grind it, & try it. Then pour it through a <span class="tl"><span class="m">coarse canvas</span></span> or a <span class="tl"><span class="m">very light tammy cloth</span></span>, in the manner that when pouring it falls into the strongest <span class="m">vinegar</span> that you can find, for the <span class="m">vinegar</span> gives it strength & prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two or three times & it will be beautiful & well purified. For imitating your <span class="m">coral</span>, you can mix a <span class="ms">quarter part</span> of <span class="m">mastic</span> within your <span class="m">purified resin</span> to render it more firm and more beautiful, & if you should take only a tear of <span class="m">mastic</span>, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.

>   The <span class="m">coral</span> made of <span class="m">gules red enamel</span> endures the <span class="tl">file</span> and polishing.

>   It is made like <span class="m">cement</span> that is stronger mixed with <span class="m">crushed <span class="del">than of</span> glass</span> rather than with <span class="m">brick</span>. Thus one mixes here with the <span class="m">vermilion</span> the <span class="m">gules red enamel</span>, which is red in body, well ground. Thus with all colors of <span class="m">enamels</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span> for panels

 
Take a <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m"><span class="pl">Venice</span> turpentine</span> & heat it in a <span class="tl">pot</span> until it simmers, and put in half a <span class="ms">lb</span> of the <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> of the whitest you can find, and stir it all together well on a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire and take it off immediately. And <span class="del">elle</span> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you, add in a little more <span class="m">oil</span>. Similarly if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <span class="m">turpentine</span>. Thus you will give it whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And it dries both <span class="env">in the shade</span> and <span class="env">in the sun</span>, and <span class="tmp">overnight</span>, and <span class="tmp">during the winter</span> as well as <span class="tmp">in the summer</span>. It is usually sold 15 <span class="cn">sols</span> a <span class="ms">lb</span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   A little more <span class="m">turpentine</span> than <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> is needed in order to give body to the <span class="m">varnish</span>, which needs to be applied with <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> in order to spread it thinner and less thick, for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not <span class="m">varnish</span> to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out of them.
 
> *at bottom margin*

> 
>   But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. <span class="m">Mastic varnish</span> does not resist <span class="env">rain</span>, whereas that of <span class="m">oil</span> and <span class="m">rosin</span> does.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Thick varnish</span> for floorboards

 
There is a <span class="m">varnish</span> that takes a long time to dry & still drips up to two <span class="tmp">months</span> after it has been applied to the floorboards. But this one does not drip like the one used <span class="tmp">in the past</span>, which was made of <span class="m">linseed oil</span> boiled with <span class="m">garlic</span>, to extinguish it & take out the fattiness, & with <span class="m">wheat</span>. And this one yellowed & made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like the other one except that one puts <span class="m">common thick turpentine</span>
