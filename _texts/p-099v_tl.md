## Quince trees

 
They have to be pruned often; otherwise they die and do not produce good fruit.
 
 
  

## Cannons

 
They are very difficult to drill when they are made of <span class="m">metal</span> since the material is rough and brittle. But you must not push the drill too strongly or push all at once, but remove it often. In that case, the cannon mouth is bigger than the bullet in order to avoid drilling, since the material can be easily cast and slides. The drill should not be like a dovetail, or a point, but should be cut in round like a crankshaft. If it breaks, don't leave it to rust \+

## Bells

 
One does not make them in the pit if they do not fit.
 
 
  

## Gilding <span class="del">your</span> molding for panels without <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Some take <span class="m">orpiment in leaf form</span> & pulverize it & make moresque leaves & burnish it, and it is this <span class="m">orpiment</span> which is shiny like <span class="m">gold</span>. However, <span class="m">ground metals</span> or <span class="m">ground cristallin</span> or <span class="m">touchstone</span> are better.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Orpiment</span> orange

 
One sublimates it & one grinds it & some put in a little <span class="m">arsenic</span> to make it melt instead.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span>

 
Some make this of <span class="m">mastic</span> with two <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">mastic</span> and one of <span class="m">clear & white turpentine oil</span> & <span class="m">eau de vye</span> as above. Heat it on <span class="m">ashes</span> until it is melted, then let it rest & put it in another <span class="tl">vessel</span> to purge it of dregs.
