To dry jams that are <span class="x">not?</span> liquid, have an open tub pierced on each side with a small, square window, and pass sticks through these from one side to the other, and place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a net. And on this, you will neatly put your jam containers. And having put at the bottom of the tub a hot coal or two, cover the tub with a cloth folded in two.
 
 
  

## To lead a horse

 
\+One has to give it sweet bread and it will recognize the one who will give him this treat.
 
And in order to keep it good for leading, make it use a good gait from the beginning of the path and continue it.
 
 
  

## Dogs

 
To keep them from biting, it is good to have <span class="m">pitch</span> balls, formed like those of cobblers, to throw to them when they yap at you. They will bite on the balls so much that their teeth will get stuck together and they will not be able to harm you.
 
 
  

## To disguise a horse

 
Cut his ears and tail and, with burning <span class="m">hay</span>, singe the hair on his head and elsewhere.
 
 
  

## Boots of <span class="m">hay</span>

 
Lacking boots, you can make a rope out of <span class="m">hay</span> and wrap it around your legs, and rain will never pass through.
