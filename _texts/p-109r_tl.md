## Modelling with <span class="m">wax</span>

 
When <span class="m">wax</span> is too hard, one mixes in <span class="m">turpentine</span> or a little <span class="m">butter</span>, which <span class="del">sont pl</span> renders the <span class="m">wax</span> more amiable, and more appropriate than the <span class="m">tallow</span> that the <span class="pl">Italians</span> put in, because one has to, often, put the <span class="tl">tools</span> in the <span class="bp">mouth</span>, which are better in <span class="m"><span class="pa">box wood</span></span> or <span class="m">bone of <span class="al">hart</span></span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Wax</span> for molding —

 
As the <span class="m">wax</span> is melted, they have <span class="m">sulphur</span> that is melted, in a <span class="tl">spoon</span> or <span class="tl">crucible</span>, & they pour some in the <span class="m">melted wax</span>. And the <span class="m">sulphur</span> going to the bottom or remaining on top, it leaves & mixes only its substance amongst the <span class="m">wax</span>, & renders it more meltable when warming it, such that having molded, it melts in the mold gently, like butter, without leaving any gently melts in the <span class="tl">mold</span> like <span class="m">butter</span>, without leaving any pustule or bubble in it. Also be warned to not give it too much fire.

## Molding <span class="m">wax</span>

 
So that your <span class="tl">mold</span> grips, without repelling in any place, on a shape or image of <span class="m">wax</span>, one needs to smear it with <span class="m">oil</span> and moisten you sand with <span class="m">lukewarm water</span>, for the <span class="m">cold water</span> would furthermore repel the <span class="m">oil</span> & would not make a good layer on it.

>   Smear well, very lightly, with <span class="m">oil</span>, so little that it hardly appears. Then rub with some <span class="m">eau de vye</span>. Next, moisten your sand with <span class="m">lukewarm water</span> so that it does not repel the <span class="m">oil</span>.

 
  

## <span class="tl">Bellows</span> of the <span class="tl">forge</span>

 
It is best that they be fixed in on some piece of membreure, through the portevent, <span class="del">q</span> for they are more secure, next you can lightly secure them from above. It is necessary that the tuelle be 4 <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> on the sole of the <span class="tl">forge</span>.

 
  

## <span class="al">Snakes</span> for molding

 
When you take them for molding, if it is possible, do not remove their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth removed, they get sore gums & mouth, & can no longer eat. You can keep them in a <span class="tl">barrel</span> full of <span class="m">bran</span> or even better of <span class="m">earth</span>, <span class="env">in a cool place</span>, or in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> bottle</span>. And give them some live <span class="al">frog</span> or other live animal for they eat nothing dead. Also I have noticed that
