## Painting on <span class="m">crystal</span> or <span class="m">glass</span>

 
They paint in <span class="m">oil</span> without lines, except for the faces where they trace the nose & the mouth with black in small work, then they make strokes & and highlights in white, next they coat all with carnation. And as for the ground, they make it with <span class="m">azur d’<span class="pl">Acre</span></span> for more beauty, or with <span class="m">lake for a quickly—done red</span>, or with <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span> for the most beauty. But one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even & of one color, & thus for other colors. Next they put underneath it a <span class="m">leaf of <span class="m">topaz</span>, or one of <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span></span>.
 
 
  

## Infusion of <span class="m">anthos</span> or <span class="m">rosemary</span>

 
It is better to cook the flower in August & more suited to <span class="m">oil</span>—making. Take as much as you want. Then put it into a bottle very well corked, & leave them to wilt in the shade for a day. Then add the first substance of <span class="m">wine</span> & leave to settle three or four days; & express it all in another vessel and into this very same substance of <span class="m">wine</span>, add seven or eight infusions made out of new flowers. Then leave the latest infusion in the sun for a month. Then distill it through a still. Then mix two ounces of this <span class="m">water</span> with two or three spoons of <span class="m">white wine</span>; but this is for the elderly. Paul the Third used it.
 
 
  

## Cast

 
<span class="m">Tin</span> comes out better being thin & fine, rather than thick, because being thick & in great heat, it retracts. Therefore, if you want to mold a thick piece in <span class="m">tin</span>, mold it only on one side, & with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to <span class="m">solder</span> two halves together. But if you have to mold it thick, make it in the form & mold a lot of abrevouers around the figure, in this way.
