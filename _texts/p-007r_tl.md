## For gilding with <span class="m">gold color</span> and <span class="m">tinsel</span>

 
Once you have <span class="del">gilded</span> <span class="add">colored</span>, make your stamped ornament in <span class="m">tin</span> as said, or in <span class="m">iron</span> <span class="del">dest</span> or <span class="m">copper</span>, one ought not to put a layer of<span class="m">glue</span> here as on <span class="m">wood</span>, but take only <span class="m">fatty oil</span>, which is made in seven or eight <span class="ms">days</span> <span class="env">in the sun</span> with <span class="m">walnut oil</span> and <span class="m">lead white</span> <span class="del">& with</span>, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in haste. Then, with the <span class="m">oil</span> thus made fatty, grind a little <span class="m">lead white</span>, <span class="m">massicot</span> & <span class="m">mine de plomb</span> <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span>, at discretion, as much of one as of the other. <span class="m">Minium</span> gives color to the <span class="m">gold</span>. Next, with this, you make a layer of it evenly on your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows. And once it is almost dry, lay the <span class="m">gold</span> leaf on it with <span class="m">cotton</span>. Such <span class="m">gold</span> will hold up <span class="env">in the rain</span> on houses & elsewhere. And if you have gilded with <span class="m">tinsel</span>, color it with <span class="m">fumée de perdrix</span> or from yellow or red <span class="m">cloth</span>, & it will be beautiful like pure <span class="m">gold</span>. You can cover trunks, mirrors, canopies & posts of beds of colored <span class="m">velvet</span> or <span class="m">satin</span> and then apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with <span class="m">strong glue</span>.
 
 
  

## For coloring stamped trunks

 
The stamp of <span class="m">sheets of copper or latten</span> is made on <span class="m"><span class="pa">service tree</span>wood</span> engraved & cut should you want to spend less. And next, the stamped object is colored with the aforesaid colours of <span class="m">lake</span>, <span class="m">verdet</span>, <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span>, & soak in <span class="m">turpentine varnish</span>. But in the place you want to <span class="m">azure</span>, lay down <span class="m">fer blanc</span>, which is more appropriate for an <span class="m">azure</span> background.
 
 
  

## Doublets

 
Good <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span> soaked in <span class="m">eau de vye</span> carries its <span class="m">mastic</span> or <span class="m">glue</span> in itself, so do <span class="m">sap—green</span> & <span class="m"><span class="pa">saffron</span></span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Fish</span> glue</span> or <span class="m">usblac</span> and <span class="m">mouth glue</span>

 
It is made from <span class="m"><span class="al">codfish</span> skin</span> that has been boiled rather than <span class="m">salted</span>. <span class="pro">Joiners</span> use it on their masterpieces and <span class="pro">guitar makers</span> use it for their more delicate works. It needs to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in barely boiling <span class="m">water</span>.
 
<span class="m">Mouth glue</span> is made of <span class="m">parchment</span> scraps and used to glue <span class="m">paper</span> or similar things without fire, by wetting it with one's <span class="tl"><span class="bp">mouth</span></span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*

> 
>   It is beaten and left to soak in <span class="m">white wine</span> for one night, then melted over a low heat. Others soak it in <span class="m">spirits</span>.
