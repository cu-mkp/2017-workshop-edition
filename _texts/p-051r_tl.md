## Making counterproofs

 
Make some <span class="m">soap water</span> & with this, rub & moisten the engraved piece that you want to counterproof from, then lay <span class="m">white paper</span> on it & rub very vigorously across the top with a <span class="tl">tooth</span> or the <span class="tl">bottom of a <span class="m">glass</span></span> & you will transfer your stamped piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but if you <span class="m">oil</span> your <span class="m">paper</span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> <span class="del">&</span><span class="add">or</span> turpentine oil</span>, it will show <span class="del">reverse</span> the right way around on the other side. Then follow these lines with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> or a <span class="tl">quill</span>, then heat the <span class="m">paper</span> & the <span class="m">oil</span> will go away & leave your <span class="m">paper</span> white. And if you want this not to be known, if, by chance, you borrowed the piece, moisten the <span class="m">paper</span> and the polishing that the <span class="tl">burnisher</span> has made on the back, which shows what has been done, will not be known. The <span class="m">soap water</span> will turn the piece yellow, but <span class="m">well—gummed water</span>, which has the same effect, does not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make <span class="m">gummed water</span>, then mix some <span class="m">soap</span> in it & do as is said.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Cutters of <span class="tl">printing plates</span></span>

 
To clean the <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> plates</span>, or to have worn ones print better, boil them for four or five <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">good hours</span></span> in a <span class="m"><span class="add">good</span> lye</span> <span class="add">with <span class="m">lye</span> which is quite spent</span>. Then make your <span class="m">ink</span> with some <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span> & not with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> & press with the <span class="tl">rollers</span>. The <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> plates</span> are sooner made than <span class="tl"><span class="m">wood</span> blocks</span>, but they are not so appropriate for printing promptly. The <span class="m">wood</span> ones are laborious but also will sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other will have done two. To carve in <span class="m">wood</span>, the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the <span class="tl"><span class="m">wood</span> block</span> & to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the <span class="m">wood</span>. Once dry, you then gently rub with a <span class="m">moist handkerchief</span> the back of the <span class="m">paper</span> which, by rubbing, will become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next, one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated <span class="m">glass</span> & coat with noir d’escaille, to then scrape & layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make <span class="m">ink</span> for <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> plates</span>
