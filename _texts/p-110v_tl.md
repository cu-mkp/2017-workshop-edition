When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it will render it. And if, after having eaten something, it is thusly pressed underfoot, this pains it a lot & hurts it. If it is wounded, it will not eat willingly.

 
  

## <span class="tl">Molds</span>

 
There is nothing better for opening them up than to smear them with <span class="m">olive oil</span>, & nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to disjoin them, soak them in cold <span class="m">water</span>, which is the secret. And you will see that the <span class="m">oil</span> although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like grease. Molds become stronger in cold <span class="m">water</span>. And hot <span class="m">water</span> would dissolve them uneasily, although once reheated, they are more handleable & easier to dissolve in the <span class="m">water</span>.

 
  

## <span class="m">Wheat oil</span>

 
Is made on a blade of <span class="m">iron</span> reddened in the fire. And the <span class="m">oil</span> drips off, which is appropriate for smearing the hair of a butterfly or similar thing, for this <span class="m">oil</span> is instantly dry & makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for it were upright it would elevate the sand and become porous.

> # If you want to mold something delicate, like a pansy, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, rub it with <span class="m">butter</span>. But it is best to smear it with <span class="m">wheat oil</span> for it has no body & does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the flower firm.

 
  

## Cast of <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>

 
Because <span class="m">tin</span> wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal, plant or other thing for molding is thin & fine, do it so that there is more <span class="m">tin</span>, much more than <span class="m">lead</span>, namely less than the fourth part <span class="m">lead</span> for three parts <span class="m">tin</span>. And still, one puts lead only to form an alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong & thick, put a lot more <span class="m">lead</span> in than <span class="m">tin</span>. And in one & the other you can put a little <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>, but only a little, with a little <span class="m">resin</span>, when you want to cast. Since then, when molding with fine & new <span class="m">lead</span>, I put into one <span class="ms">lb</span> two <span class="ms">ounces</span> of fine <span class="m">tin</span>. And when molding with fine <span class="m">tin</span>, I put in two ounces of fine <span class="m">lead</span> for one pound. I made plants & snakes just like nature.

>  I cast <span class="m">tin</span> almost red, and <span class="m">lead</span> the same, which however had not remained in the fire for too long, for it becomes brittle and calcines.
