*[continued]*
  
When it has eaten something, by tormenting it, it will render it. And if, after having eaten something, it is thusly pressed <span class="tl"><span class="bp">underfoot</span></span>, this pains it a lot & hurts it. If it is wounded, it will not eat willingly.

 
  

## <span class="tl">Molds</span>

 
There is nothing better for opening them up than to smear them with <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive</span> oil</span>, & nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to disjoin them, soak them in <span class="m">cold water</span>, which is the secret. <span class="del">L</span><span class="add">E</span> And you will see that the <span class="m">oil</span> although it seems to be imbued, will detach itself, like grease. <span class="tl">Molds</span> become stronger in <span class="m">cold water</span>. And <span class="m">hot water</span> would dissolve them uneasily, although once reheated, they are more handleable & easier to dissolve in the <span class="m">water</span>.

 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pa">Wheat</span> oil</span>

 
Is made on a <span class="tl">blade of <span class="m">iron</span> reddened in the fire</span>. And the <span class="m">oil</span> drips off, which is appropriate for smearing the hair of a <span class="al">butterfly</span> or similar thing, for this <span class="m">oil</span> is instantly dry & makes the remainder dry out. It is necessary that the hair or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, for it were upright it would elevate the sand & become porous.

> # If you want to mold something delicate, like a <span class="pa">pansy</span>, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, rub it with <span class="m">butter</span>. But it is best to smear it with <span class="m"><span class="pa">wheat</span> oil</span> for it has no body & does not obstruct the small lineaments as much, and makes the flower firm.

 
  

## Cast of <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>

 
Because <span class="m">tin</span> wants to be cast very thinly, if your medal, plant or other thing for molding is <span class="del">espe</span> thin & fine, do it so that there is more <span class="m">tin</span>, much more than <span class="m">lead</span>, namely less than the <span class="ms">fourth part <span class="m">lead</span> for three parts <span class="m">tin</span></span>. And still, one puts <span class="m">lead</span> only to form an alloy. On the contrary, if you want to mold something strong & thick, put a lot more <span class="m">lead</span> in than <span class="m">tin</span>. And in one & the other you can put a little <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>, but only a little, with a little <span class="m">resin</span>, when you want to cast. <span class="add">Since then, when molding with <span class="m">fine and new lead</span>, I put into one <span class="ms">lb</span> two <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">fine tin</span>. And when molding with <span class="m">fine tin</span>, I put in two <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">fine lead</span> for one <span class="ms">pound</span>. I made plants & <span class="al">snakes</span> just like nature.</span>
