## <span class="pro">Mat Makers</span>

 
Two kinds are made in <span class="pl">Toulouse</span>, one to cover rooms' walls which are finely woven, almost like <span class="m">straw</span> hats worn by villagers, and are made in long rolls, some 10 <span class="m">straws</span> wide, others 13. And they work on them mainly in summer and winter. Then when they prepare it they sew it, but beforehand they dye it in usually three colours: green, red and sometimes purple. The green one is made with only a <span class="m">pastel tincture</span> since green is made from yellow and blue, so the <span class="m">pastel</span> dyes the dark yellow <span class="m">straw</span>. It becomes bright green. For red they use some <span class="m">alum</span> and <span class="m">brazil wood</span>, for purple they use <span class="m">pastel</span> and some <span class="m">coperous</span> which darkens blue with its black tincture.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Glassmakers</span>

 
They have no way to produce a perfect red that needs to be annealed. Try, however, the <span class="m"><span class="pl">German</span> red</span> which is scaled red. They produce their ordinary red with some <span class="m">sanguine</span>, <span class="m">iced pewter</span>, <span class="m">lead rocks</span>, & some <span class="m">iron file dust</span>. This red is to be applied on both sides of the <span class="m">glass</span> because it is more colourful. If it were applied on one side only it would look pastel orange.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Founder</span>

 
They pay xx <span class="cn">lb</span> for a <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">rosette</span>, which is harder to melt than <span class="m">latten</span> because it is softer. For, the softer the <span class="m"><span class="add">great</span> metals</span> <span class="add">#</span> are, the <span class="del">soft</span> harder they are to melt. The <span class="m">tin used to make bells</span>, which is <span class="m">fine tin</span> <span class="del">is more</span> and which is brittle, is easier to melt than <span class="m">lead, which is soft</span>. <span class="m">Latten, made brittle by the <span class="m">calamine</span></span> is melted more quickly than <span class="m">red copper</span>. The <span class="m">metal, which is the substance of bells</span>, mixed with <span class="m">tin</span>, and very brittle, is soon melted. The more <span class="m">silver</span> is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is why <span class="m">solder</span> is made with it. In <span class="pl">Germany</span> they make very light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of <span class="m">water</span>, but they are breakable. A <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="del">per</span> <span class="m">fine <span class="pro">coppersmith</span>'s rosette</span> is sold for xxx or 40 <span class="cn">lb</span>. Another type used by <span class="pro">founders</span> is sold for xii or xv <span class="cn">lb</span>. The <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">metal</span>, six <span class="cn">lb</span>.<span class="del">Put in</span>
