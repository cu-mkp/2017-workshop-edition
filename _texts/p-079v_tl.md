*[continued]*
  
and put it into an <span class="tl"><span class="m">earthen</span>pot</span>, & it should have many hot <span class="m">ashes</span> underneath, & little by little you will make the fire underneath bigger and bigger, & one ought not move it, & when it will be cooked, & it needs to be for six <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span>, mind that the <span class="m">smoke</span> does not harm you for it is bad.

 
  

## For making <span class="m">varnish</span>

 
Take some <span class="m">mastic</span>, <span class="m">sang <span class="del">daRage</span> <span class="add">darac</span></span>, <span class="m">gum arabic</span> & <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>, as much of one as the other, & make them melt all together, & before coating it, lay a coat of <span class="m">glue quite clear</span>, & let it dry.

 
  

## Antidote against the <span class="m">smoke of metals</span>

 
In the morning, take a piece of thin <span class="m">toast</span> with <span class="m">butter</span>, neither <span class="m">antimony</span> nor any other vapors will harm you. Or put half a <span class="m"><span class="al">pig</span>'s bladder</span> in front of your face.

 
  

## <span class="m">Tin</span> for casting

 
They use <span class="m">common tin</span>, which is the one that <span class="pro">pewterers</span> use to make dishes, which is composed of 9 or <span class="del">ten</span> ten <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">fine lead</span> for one <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">tin</span>.

> Some find that there is nothing better than <span class="m">fine tin</span>.

 
  

## Mixture for <span class="pro">printers</span>

 
Make a layer of <span class="m"><span class="add">pulverized</span> antimony</span>, & a layer of <span class="m">latten</span> & <span class="m">old scrapings or thin plates of iron</span> or <span class="del">clo</span> <span class="m">iron nail heads</span>, and continue in this way until the <span class="tl">crucible</span> is full. And melt inside a <span class="tl">four à vent</span>, & then mix a little <span class="m">tin</span> & fill up the <span class="tl">crucible</span> with <span class="m">lead</span> <span class="del">until it causes it</span>. And increase the fire & mix to make the substances alloy well. The mixture for large letters is harder.
