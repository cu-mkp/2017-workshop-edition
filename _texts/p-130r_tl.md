## Drying animals in an oven

 
One can skin small <span class="al">cats</span> and remove their eyes and all their guts. Then place a small stick vertically between the teeth in order to open their mouths. Then with <span class="m">iron nails</span> one should attach their feet to a small board, arrange the required position. Once they are tied by their feet with small <span class="m">iron rings</span>, one has to hang them upside down into the sun. By doing so, they will get the right shape and dry, the belly will tighten and the the tail will remain high up thanks to the twist that you made. Once they are already a bit dry, one may twist the head as he wishes and secure the position with any tool. One may finish to dry the animal by placing it in an oven once the bread has been taken off. Then place some realistically painted <span class="m">lead</span> balls or <span class="m">wax</span> balls in the eye—sockets. One should paint them with <span class="m">gummed ink</span> so that they look like jet. One can add a painted tongue, or horns, or wings or anything you may imagine, same goes for <span class="al">rats</span> or any animal.

 
  

## Reddening lively <span class="al">crayfish</span> which will look as if they were boiled

 
Rub your <span class="al">crayfish</span> with good <span class="m">vinegar</span> diluted with a little <span class="m">eau—de—vie</span> and not much, then you can present them as if they were cooked and yet they will walk.

 
  

## Molding a single <span class="al">spider</span>

 
One has to display it on the jacket of <span class="m">clay</span> as it is said for the <span class="m">vine leaf</span>. Then do the first cast. And once it dry, peel the mold off to the middle of the legs and do the second cast.

 
  

## Molding a single <span class="m">vine leaf</span>

 
Attach it with <span class="m">brass</span> wire points on the jacket of <span class="m">clay</span> and then cast the first mold. Once it is dry peel off the back side and make the second cast. Then peel away the back side, and make your second cast. Once it is dry, you may remove the leaf. You must heat your mold only once, because there is nothing to be burnt inside.

>   Also. One cannot mold the hairy legs of big <span class="al">spiders</span> or any other hairy animal if they had not been rubbed with <span class="m">wheat oil</span> before they are laid flat. This will make the <span class="m">hair</span> firmer and will dry very quickly. Hairy things entangle in the sand, and do not burn very well.
