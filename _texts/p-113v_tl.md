such that while reheating the two casts will disjoin. <span class="del">Et pour pl</span> Therefore, for this effect, take several <span class="tl">bowls of different size, which have a lip</span>, to cast better. In these pour some <span class="m">common <span class="env">fountain</span> water</span>, & mix into it <span class="ms">as much <span class="m">essence of sal ammoniac</span> as can be held in an <span class="m">egg</span></span>, <span class="add">#</span> composed as mentionned. If you want to cast in <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span> — because one would need more for casting <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span> — the <span class="m">essence</span> once in your <span class="tl">bowl</span>, <span class="del">mesles</span> put <span class="del">y</span> your sand in it & not the <span class="m">essence</span> in the sand & add it <span class="del">a dista dista</span>with such discretion that <span class="del">il</span>, while stirring & mixing it promptly with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">wooden</span> spoon</span>, it does not become thicker than <span class="m"><span class="del">clear</span> mustard</span>. And thus throw <span class="del">le</span> first the non—thick part, <span class="del">qui es</span> as is always at the surface, in shakes & <span class="del">da</span> at the top of your <span class="tl">mold</span>. And doing so, since your animal is nearly covered, blow strongly everywhere in order to dissipate the small and big bubbles that the wet sand makes & continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, & a little thicker than the top, until everything is filled, up to the mark for thickness that you made.

 And do not forget to shake the <span class="tl">mold</span> <span class="del">affin</span> while throwing, so that the wet sand runs & enters well everywhere. Also tip your <span class="tl">mold</span> up on the side of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your <span class="tl">mold</span> will have the same thickness, & you will spare sand. All of this being done scrupulously <span class="del">fai</span>, let it set, which will take a <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">quarter of an hour</span></span>. Then release the <span class="m">clay</span> circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry a little bit, & separate your <span class="tl">mold</span> from the tourtelle <span class="m">earth</span>, which also <span class="del">de</span> will be appropriate for molding right away, and pare the excess with a big <span class="tl">knife</span>, giving to it the long shape of a <span class="mu">mandore</span>. <span class="del">Rasche</span> Scrape & cut also away the back <span class="add">of the <span class="tl">mold</span></span>, which is always the weakest, and adapt it cleanly thusly. And do not forget to make notches around, so that the second cast fixes & binds better

For there is no risk in it being very clear, because sand always settles in the bottom & <span class="m">water</span> separates & remains on top. The same that one scrapes since it is too weak & soft. And it will not let itself set quickly, for all things calcined dry out promptly from mixed <span class="m">water</span>.

 If you don't fill in one go your <span class="tl">mold</span> <span class="del">destrempe</span> with wet sand, take head to stir your second cast with the <span class="del">e p</span> surface of the first, <span class="del">p</span> by mixing with the <span class="tl">spoon</span> or a <span class="tl">spatula</span> with which you wet it.
