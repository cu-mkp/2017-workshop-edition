to cast, make him take through the mouth some good <span class="m">eau de vye</span> or else mix a bit with the <span class="m">vinegar</span>. And soon it will be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for whom one would need a lot of <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, one uses <span class="m">vinegar</span> and <span class="m">urine</span>. But for small ones, only <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, which is done sooner. <br/> When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it scrupulously of its old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the lice, like <span class="al">lizards</span> have, and then apply thusly.

## Making the arrangement and disposition of the animal

 
Having stocked up some fat <span class="m">earth</span> called <span class="m">clay</span>, that should be grey, because that commonly the best, or another which has good binding & will should well prepared & beaten, such that it is handleable without attacking the hands nor the work, make a lazagne or like a torteau of this <span class="m">earth</span> equally flattened with a round stick, which <span class="pro">pastry—makers</span> use, which should be a little thicker than a poulce. And on this tourtelle, arrange your animal, imitating its naturalness, & the way in which it is commonly shaped. And firstly, with a good needle, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, & up to the top bone of the head. Retract the needle, & in its place & its hole, put the point of an <span class="m">iron</span> wire, of such a length that it suffices to hold the head of the animal as high as it must be, & if the skin gets in to the inside<span class="del">&</span> when you put in the point, pull it out with the edge of your small pincers, & arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the point in the tourtelle of <span class="m">clay</span>. Thus, the head will be held high, which will have better grace &once fixed, arrange after the gesture of the body, & the feet, & the entanglement as you think will look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you throw in the sand, secure the legs with little points of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, having already made the first hole with a very sharp needle. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, making sure that the points passing through the animal are fixed in the tourtelle of earth, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a

> Take a needle of fine <span class="m">steel</span>, & which is the sharpest possible, so that with it, making the first hole to place the points of iron, it passes without forcing anything, & by its harshness, does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a bigger point of iron in thick places, & thin ones in thin places. But head as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the point passed through the animal in the plaster of earth, but having planted it, take it out of the earth & not out of the animal, &next, fix it. This is done because by fixing it the first time, it pushes in the skin of the snake and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.
