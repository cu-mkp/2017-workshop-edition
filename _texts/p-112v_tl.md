to cast, make him take through the mouth some good <span class="m">eau de vye</span> or else mix a bit with the <span class="m">vinegar</span>. And soon it will be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for whom one would need a lot of <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, one uses <span class="m">vinegar</span> and <span class="del">er</span> <span class="m">urine</span>. But for small ones, only <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, which is done sooner. <br/> When your animal is dead, take it out & clean it scrupulously of its old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the <span class="al">lice</span>, like <span class="al">lizards</span> have, and then apply thusly.

## <span class="del">Mouler</span> Making the arrangement and disposition of the animal

 
Having stocked up some <span class="m">fat earth</span> called <span class="m">clay</span>, that should be grey, because that commonly the best, or another which has good binding & will should well prepared & beaten, such that it is handleable without attacking the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span> nor the work, make a lazagne or like a torteau of this <span class="m">earth</span> equally flattened with a <span class="tl">round stick, which <span class="pro">pastry—makers</span></span> use, which should be a little thicker than a <span class="ms"><span class="bp">poulce</span></span>. And on this tourtelle, arrange your animal, <span class="del">aya</span> imitating its naturalness, & <span class="del">fa</span> the way in which it is commonly shaped. And firstly, with a good <span class="tl">needle</span>, pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, & up to <span class="del">u <span class="ill"></span></span> the top bone of the head. Retract the <span class="tl">needle</span>, & in its place & its hole, put the <span class="tl">point of an <span class="m">iron wire</span></span>, of such a length that it suffices to hold the head of the animal as <span class="del">q</span> high as it must be, & if the skin gets in to the inside <span class="del">&</span> when you put in the <span class="tl">point</span>, pull it out with <span class="del">a</span> <span class="del"><span class="tl">point</span></span> the edge of your small <span class="tl">pincers</span>, & arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the <span class="tl">point</span> in the tourtelle of <span class="m">clay</span>. Thus, the head will be held high, which will have better grace &once fixed, arrange after the gesture of the body, & the feet, & the entanglement as you think will look best. And so that it is secure & does not move at all when you throw in the sand, <span class="del">mects</span> secure the legs <span class="del">& le corp</span> with little <span class="tl">points of <span class="m">iron wire</span></span>, having already made the first hole with a very sharp <span class="tl">needle</span>. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary, <span class="del">plantant</span> making sure that the <span class="tl">points</span> passing through the animal are fixed in the tourtelle of earth, and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal by a

>   Take a <span class="tl">fine needle of <span class="m">steel</span></span>, & which is the sharpest possible, so that with it, making the first hole to place the <span class="tl">points of <span class="m">iron</span></span>, it passes without forcing anything, & by its harshness, does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a bigger <span class="tl">point of <span class="m">iron</span></span> in thick places, & thin ones in thin places. But head as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the <span class="tl">point</span> passed through the animal in the slab of <span class="m">earth</span>, <span class="del">pour</span> but having planted it, take it out of the <span class="m">earth</span> & not out of the animal, & <span class="del">fais ains</span> next, fix it. This is done because by fixing it the first time, it pushes in the skin of the <span class="al">snake</span> and by taking the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.

For this effect, pierce the head on a <span class="tl">solid plank or table</span> <span class="del">& <span class="ill"></span></span>, making the <span class="tl">point</span> pass through the bottom of the throat, <span class="del">s’arrestan</span> entering into the top of the head
