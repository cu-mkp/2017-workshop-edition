## For casting

 
<span class="m">Asphaltum <span class="del">is</span>, which is found in <span class="pl">Germany</span></span>, is the most excellent sand one can find for molding in a <span class="tl">frame</span>, because it is appropriate for <span class="m">silver</span> & for <span class="m">gold</span>, & the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. One molds in it very thinly & finely.
 
 
  

## <span class="add">Making <span class="m">gold</span> run</span> for casting

 
Because <span class="m">gold</span> cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a mix when <span class="del">melted q</span> it is well melted which maintains the heat. <span class="m">Sublimate</span> softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore mix this composition when you want to cast: <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, the best <span class="m">verdet</span> that you can find, a little <span class="m">borax</span> & <span class="m">saltpeter</span> <span class="del"><span class="add">qui li</span></span>. And this, by keeping it warm, it will come out neatly. <span class="add"><span class="m">Saltpeter</span> clarifies it & <span class="del">p</span> heats it. But the most important thing in this mixture is the <span class="m">verdet</span>, which has to be good. This mixture softens the <span class="m">gold</span> <span class="del">qui</span> so much that it becomes treatable like <span class="m">lead</span>, even <span class="m">fine gold</span>.</span>
 
For sand for molding flowers & leaves & delicate things, mix in <span class="m">well—ground raw plaster</span>, <span class="m">brick</span> & <span class="m">alum de plume</span>.
 
To moisten sands, <span class="m">eau de vye</span> is excellent, for it grinds the sand finely & evaporates <span class="del">que</span> when one reheats the <span class="tl">frames</span>.
 
<span class="m">Sal ammoniac water</span> is very good, is excellent for moistening sands, but for lots of <span class="m">water</span> one only needs a little <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>.
 
A lump of <span class="m">iron</span>, for lack of <span class="m">crocum ferri</span>, is <span class="del">exce</span> good for <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
The <span class="al">snakes</span> or <span class="al">lizards</span> you want to mold should not be kept for a <span class="tmp">long time</span>, for if they are alive, they get thin, and if they are <span class="del">dry il</span> dead, they wither.
 
<span class="m">Plaster of <span class="pl">Paris</span></span> is as firm as <span class="m">stone</span> & very good. When you will want to choose some for your sand, take it raw, the hardest possible & which does not make any powder. The transparent one and the one that thusly makes powder retracts, <span class="del">Ce</span> which is not good for this work. A sign of the one that is close to perfection is that it is hard & made of lustrous grains nearing the shape of <span class="m">sugar</span>. Finally, to mix some into the sand to cast <span class="m">gold</span>, it is necessary that it endures the fire twice, & is reheated twice.
