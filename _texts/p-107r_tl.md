 as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste & that it is not so easy to handle, as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws big bubbles or exhalations in the middle & around, as long as a <span class="ms"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the fire for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it would be too much & would not set as well. For, when it becomes red & overheats, it loses its strength & spoils the sand. Leave it to cool before mixing it within the other sands. And when it is cold, mix and mold, for as soon as you will use it after its cooking, the sooner it will set.
 
 
  

## Catching <span class="al">lizards</span> and <span class="al">snakes</span>

 
Take a <span class="tl">stick</span> and attach a <span class="tl">string</span> at the end, which has a <span class="del">knot</span> <span class="del"><span class="add">eyelet</span></span> slip <span class="add">eyelet</span> at the end. And, being two to three, to distract the <span class="al">lizard</span> while whistling, approach the eyelet towards his neck, and when his head is inside, pull. <span class="add">The <span class="al">lizard</span> is more tedious to catch by <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hand</span></span> than the <span class="al">snake</span> & bites without letting go & grips like <span class="tl">pincers</span>.</span>
 
<span class="al">Snakes</span> can be caught by <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hand</span></span>, provided that it is covered by a thick <span class="tl"><span class="m">woollen</span> cloth</span>, for the teeth of the <span class="al">snake</span> stay in the <span class="tl">cloth</span>, & cannot pierce like they would with a <span class="m">linen</span>. The dangerous ones are recognisable by their blue eyes & <span class="del">asses</span> deep azur <span class="add">azures</span>. They hardly ever bite <span class="env">in water</span>, which <span class="pro"><span class="al">crayfish</span> catchers</span> experience.
 
The sand mixture is of two <span class="ms">parts</span> of <span class="m">plaster pulverized & reheated</span> as said, & of one <span class="ms">part</span> of <span class="m">tile</span>, reddened <span class="del">et p pre</span> <span class="add">in a good fire</span>, after the first cooking & then finely pulverized, and of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>, <span class="ms">half</span> of <span class="m">brick</span>, namely two full <span class="ms"><span class="tl">crucibles</span></span> of <span class="m">plaster</span>, one of <span class="m">brick</span> & a half of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>. There can never be too much <span class="m">alum de plume</span>,<span class="del">s</span> for this is what gives bond to the sand, and because it does not burn, it makes sand withstand the fire without cracking & bursting. Otherwise, without it, the sand would not withstand it. This sand, thus composed, is proper for all <span class="m">metals</span>, but if you want to use it for <span class="m">gold</span>, one needs more <span class="m">alum de plume</span> <span class="del">&</span> than the above mentioned composition, and mix in some <span class="m">crocum ferri</span>, and for it is this one that attracts <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
It is necessary that all sand with which you want to cast well, withstands the fire well, that is to say that it withstands <span class="del">abon</span> <span class="del">c</span> a great firing without getting spoiled.
 
<span class="m">Alum de plume</span> is uneasy to pestle, and it does not pass through the <span class="tl">sieve</span>. Thusly one needs to grind it finely on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>. And <span class="m">the one, white, <span class="del">que v</span> in powder, that <span class="pro">apothecaries</span> sell</span>, is good.<span class="add"> It is grinds better <span class="del">su</span> in the <span class="tl">mortar</span> by pestling &dragging the <span class="tl">pinon</span>, thus you will render it very fine.</span>
 
<span class="m">Crocum ferri</span> must be set ablaze in a <span class="tl"><span class="pro">glassworker</span>’s furnace</span> for four <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>.
