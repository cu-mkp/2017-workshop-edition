## <span class="pro">Sheathmaker</span>

 
<span class="pro">Sheathmakers</span>use small <span class="m">skins</span> of <span class="al">lambs</span> and young <span class="al">goats</span> very delicate, as it were like <span class="m">parchment</span> and they keep them in humid places constantly re—wetted. When they want to print some history they lay them in the hollows of their figure and then on top they spread some fatty fine <span class="m">earth</span> used for degreasing cloth, well pressed and beaten and slightly humid and soft and then put on the <span class="m">earth</span> a small one—piece board and put the whole under a press and leave that dry there. After the <span class="m">earth</span> the <span class="m">leather</span> only remains very neatly printed <span class="x">missing word</span> of the size of a pea. And then apply on the <span class="m">leather</span> two or three <span class="m">black copperas</span> and <span class="m">iron scale</span> layers one after the other like the <span class="pro">tanners</span> do. And since this tincture is astringent and shrinks the leather will be stronger more more easily printable. Once dried stick on the reverse some <span class="m">fabric</span> with strong <span class="m">glue</span>, and by doing so one can quickly imitate big statues and very fine medals and paint them and <span class="ill"></span> and are light and can be carried and last for a long time. What can be printed on a relief can be made differently and can be reheated with a hot <span class="m">iron</span> tool.

 
  

## <span class="pro">Painter</span>

 
Good <span class="tl"><span class="m">crayons</span></span> are not made with <span class="del">good</span> <span class="m">glue</span> but with <span class="m">women's milk</span>.
 
Images made of <span class="m">carton</span>, once dry, have to be soaked in <span class="m">thoroughly macerated and clear melted resin</span>. This strengthens it, otherwise they turn limp in <span class="env">wet weather</span>.
 
<span class="pl">Venice</span> masks are made with a hollow & male face of <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
The <span class="pl">Flemish</span> do not use any whites for flesh colors in <span class="m">oil</span> other than <span class="m">lead white</span> because the <span class="m">ceruse</span> turns yellow.
 
4 or 5 <span class="tmp">year</span>—old <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> which is clear is the best color, it keeps off dust. The kind which has recently been drawn with the press in the manner of <span class="m"><span class="pa">almond</span> oil</span> is white, especially if the <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnuts</span>' skin</span> is removed.
