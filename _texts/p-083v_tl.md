## A way for molding excellently with <span class="m">water</span>

 
 Dissolve in <span class="env">damp place</span> some <span class="m">tallow of glass</span>, and then place this <span class="m">water</span> on what you want to mold, having encircled it, and place it to coagulate on the hot <span class="m">ashes</span>. Do the same with <span class="m">vitriol</span> & <span class="m">copperas</span>, which, once well calcined, reduce in <span class="m">water</span>.
 
 
  

##  Molding in relief on one part and hollow on the other.

 
 It is necessary to cast two pieces of <span class="m">copper</span>, <span class="m">latten</span> or similar <span class="m">metal</span>, very neatly, and then when you have molded the cavity in the sand, leave the figure of <span class="m">metal</span> that you have molded in the <span class="tl">frame</span>, without moving it from its place. And cast, & if there is not enough thickness press a little & push the figure down in the <span class="tl">frame</span>.
 
 It is good to mold always the faces not on the side of the cast, but with the head on the bottom, because the force of the substance is at the entry of the medal, & there, where the force is, the <span class="m">filth</span> & <span class="m">grime</span> accumulate. And, in this way, if you were mold the face towards the cast, some <span class="m">grime</span> could be found there, & it is better that is found on the clothing, which is easier to repair.
 
 <span class="m">Vinegar</span> is better for moistening than <span class="m">wine</span>. It is necessary that the <span class="tl">frame</span> be well smooth and even, otherwise <span class="del">and that the cast be</span>, as you press on one side, the other one lifts.
 
 This is why the <span class="tl">press</span> is better, for it tightens evenly, & more than your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span>, and makes the <span class="m">lumpy sand</span>, which is damp, communicate its humidity to the <span class="m">soft & fine sand</span>, which is sprinkled & poncé dry on the medal.
 
 When you mold, always leave your medal in <span class="del">one of</span> <span class="add">the</span> <span class="tl">frames</span>, <span class="del">is</span> <span class="add">without stirring it</span> because, if your cavity is not molded very neatly, you can put it back in the right place by means of <span class="tl">pegs</span>, which will prevent it from shifting. But, at first, ponce yout medal with very fine <span class="m"><span class="pa">willow</span> charcoal</span>, & <span class="del">se</span> next clean it, for this degreases it, & makes it easier to release.
 
Do not knock it when molding because this will shake loose the <span class="tl">frame</span> & the sand.

** <span class="tl">Bellows</span> **

 
To melt with <span class="tl">bellows</span>, & hasten your fonte, & also cast hotter <span class="del">po</span>, do not place your <span class="tl">bellows</span> at the bottom near the foot of the <span class="tl">furnace</span>, for fear that some <span class="m">charcoal </span>might <span class="del">you</span> enters it, put them almost under the <span class="tl">grille</span>. It is good that your <span class="tl">bellow furnace</span> be in an <span class="env">aerated place</span> so that the <span class="env">wind</span> might make it heat better, & that it be well dry & and reheat. One ought to plug the doors of the <span class="tl">furnace</span> & that there is only entry of the tuelle of the <span class="tl">bellows</span>. And by the end, one ought to give it a good stoking, since at the beginning you will blow gently.
