## For the <span class="bp">teeth</span> <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span>

 
Some people whiten them with confections of <span class="m">aquafortis</span>, however one says that this corrupts them afterwards & causes a blackness on them. One says that <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span> is excellent, but one needs to mix it in this way: take as much <span class="m"><span class="pa">clove</span> oil</span> as can be held in a <span class="ms"><span class="m">walnut</span> shell</span>, and as much <span class="m">rose honey</span>, & seven or eight <span class="ms">drops</span> of <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span>, & mix it well all together. And after having cleaned the <span class="bp">teeth</span> with a <span class="tl">small burin</span>, touch them lightly with a <span class="del">end</span> little <span class="m">cotton</span> dipped in the aforesaid <span class="m">oils</span> and leave it for a little while, then spit or rinse your <span class="bp">mouth</span> with <span class="m">tepid water</span>, and reiterate two or three times. <span class="m">Oil of sulfur</span> penetrates & is corrosive, <span class="del">and the</span> but the <span class="m"><span class="pa">clove</span> oil</span> & the <span class="m">rose honey</span> correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.

## Against the falling sickness

 
Have fresh <span class="m">crow eggs</span>, either four or five, and <span class="del">the</span> over the space of four or five mornings cook one, and having mixed in it a bit of powdered <span class="m">gentian</span> and a drop of <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span>, give it to the patient. It is believed that the pain will not return.
 
 
  

## Against cold gouts

## Tree flowers

 
Those that are seen with every new ☾ are hardly profitable. Only two buds need to be left on the graft.
