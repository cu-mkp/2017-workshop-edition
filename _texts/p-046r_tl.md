## <span class="m">Oil of sulfur</span> for the teeth

 
Some people whiten them with compositions of <span class="m">eau forte</span>, however one says that this corrupts them afterwards and causes them to blacken. One says that <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span> is excellent, but it needs to be applied in this way: take as much <span class="m">clove oil</span> as can be held in a <span class="m">nutshell</span>, as much <span class="m">rose honey</span>, and seven or eight drops of <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span>, and put it all together, and after having cleaned the teeth with a small burin, touch them lightly with a <span class="del">good</span> bit of <span class="m">cotton</span> dipped in the aforementioned oils and leave it for a little while, then spit it out or rinse the mouth with tepid water, and repeat two or three times. <span class="m">Oil of sulfur</span> penetrates and is corrosive, <span class="del">and l</span> but the <span class="m">clove oil</span> and the <span class="m">rose honey</span> correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Wheat oil</span>

 
Applying it to hair makes it fall out and keeps it from growing back.
 
 
  

## Against the falling sickness

 
Have fresh <span class="m">crow eggs</span>, either four or five, and <span class="del">the</span> over the space of four or five mornings cook one, and having mixed in it a bit of powdered <span class="m">gentian</span> and a drop of <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span>, give it to the patient. It is believed that the pain will not return.
 
 
  

## Against cold gouts

 
Put <span class="m">Guaiac oil</span> together with <span class="m">oil of sulfur</span> and apply.
 
 
  

## Tree flowers

 
Those that are seen with every new â˜¾ are hardly profitable. Only two buds need to be left on the graft.
