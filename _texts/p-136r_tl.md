<span class="x">FROM PREVIOUS PAGE: And continue blowing with the small bellows, and the <span class="m">gold</span> will turn shiny like</span> a mirror. And once you will want to <span class="x">start</span> casting, put a bit more colour in and let it rest a little, still blowing wind with both the small and the large bellows. Finally, place your mold quite red between the small molds or in a crusol full of <span class="m">sand</span> quite hot and <span class="x">start</span> casting. And once it will have stuck, you may, if you wish, throw it into <span class="m">water</span> as <span class="m">gold</span> does not get damaged like <span class="m">tin</span> which breaks.
 
To melt <span class="m">gold</span> bullion, there is no need to blow above <span class="x">the crusol</span> with the small bellow.
 
For large works, the crusol made of <span class="m">sand</span> has to be placed in a wind oven so that it is all red at the end of the furnace.
 
<span class="m">Gold</span>, when exposed to wind or when forged becomes black. But a bit of <span class="m">aqua forte</span> removes <span class="x">the black</span> instantly.
 
If you have to forge a work made of <span class="m">gold</span> on <span class="m">brass</span>, as is done on small statues, put a <span class="m">lead</span> sheet between the <span class="m">gold</span> and the <span class="m">brass</span>, and rather than anneal it and put it back in the fire, dip it in the <span class="m">aqua forte</span> and it will be soft.
 
It is enough for the cast to be of the same thickness as the medal, that it from the middle of the cast, up to the medal. But if the medal is very thick, one should not thicken the cast as a result, because a thick cast never comes out well. It may be done large to embrace the medal as much as possible.
 
 
  

## Enamelling thin works

 
<span class="pro">Goldsmiths</span> polish the <span class="m">gold</span> leaf using a burin and then they apply the <span class="m">enamel</span> onto it.
