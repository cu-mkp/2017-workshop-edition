## <span class="m">Mastic varnish</span> dry in a <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">half hour</span></span>

 
 Some take 2 <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">mastic</span>, <span class="ms">half ℥</span> of <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="ms">half ℥</span> of <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> & <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, a little at your discretion, because it evaporates when heated & nonetheless makes the <span class="m">varnish</span> more desiccative. But I made it thus: I take <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> at discretion & put in a good bit of <span class="m">turpentine</span>, because it remains always moist & attaches itself if one puts in too much, & <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, & heat in a <span class="tl">varnished bowl</span> the said <span class="m">oil</span>, & when it begins to be very hot, I put in some <span class="m">subtly ground mastic</span> & around <span class="ms">one—third</span> of the <span class="m">oil</span> passed through a <span class="tl">sieve</span> <span class="del">l</span>, and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on hot <span class="m">ashes</span>. Once all melted, try it on the <span class="tl">knife</span>, and if you see that it has too much body, add in a little <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, and if it does not have enough, add in <span class="m">mastic</span>, and thus it well be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When you want to make it, be careful to sort & choose the <span class="m">mastic</span> that is white & purified of any dirt & dust & black dross. And when you wash it & dry it to render it very white & clean, it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these <span class="m"><span class="pa">straws</span></span> & marks, pulverised into it, will remain within the <span class="m">varnish</span>, & when you set it on white or carnation, it will appear that they are <span class="al">fleas</span> & blemishes. Once well chosen, pulverise it in a <span class="tl">mortar</span> and pass it through a <span class="tl">very fine sieve</span>, and next mix it in <span class="m">oil</span>, as is said. But if you want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of <span class="m">mastic</span>, as you know, pulverise, pass, & mix, and you will have something very singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on it, for this will make the <span class="m">varnish</span> whiten & take body.

>   One knows that this <span class="m">varnish</span> does not have body enough when it does not take well on a panel in <span class="m">oil</span> for it is like <span class="m">water</span>. Add in therefore <span class="m">pulverized mastic</span> & heat until it is good. This <span class="m">varnish</span> is very white & beautiful, & does not go to your head like that of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span>.

## Painting on glass

 
 It is a strange thing that the workers in this craft can only work if they have good breath, for if they have bad breath their work will crack when refired.
