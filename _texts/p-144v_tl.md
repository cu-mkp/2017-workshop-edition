*[continued]*
  
having been thusly arranged and well cleaned with brushes, put the circle of <span class="m">clay</span> around the base. Then, with a roll of <span class="m">clay</span> placed on the middle of the back of the <span class="al">turtle</span>, as you can see, and at the widest place, divide your mold. Next, <span class="m">oil</span> with your <span class="m">oiling</span> brush half the half of the shell you want to mold. If you sand is a bit thick, temper your sand with <span class="m">warm water</span>, so that without burning yourself you can put your finger in it without burning it. And before casting it, rub the shell with <span class="m">spirits</span>. And then cast your sand and let it take hold. And note that all things that have shells, or that are hard, or do not yield as <span class="al">snakes</span> and <span class="al">lizards</span> do, must be <span class="m">oiled</span> to come out cleanly. The things that yield do not need this. <span class="m">Warm water</span> means that the tempered sand sits better on the <span class="m">oil</span>, which otherwise would not work. With the half <span class="al">turtle</span> having been thusly molded, separate it with its mold from its <span class="m">clay</span> base, which you will put aside to use when needed. Then clean your half—mold, join it and flatten it like for the others. But because there will be the roll of <span class="m">clay</span>, the half mold will have more than just half the <span class="al">turtle</span> in it, cut and crop cleanly the excess <span class="sup">clay</span> and clean everything well with the brushes. Then at the top of the edge of the mold on the side where it is cut, at the halfway mark, make two notches as you have done with other molds. And flip the <span class="al">turtle</span> on its base, as it was, and secure the two legs that are not molded with <span class="m">iron</span> pins and fill the empty areas around it, up to the edge of the top shell with some <span class="m">clay</span>. Then place the circle around it and place a roll of <span class="m">clay</span> on the first mold, a bit above the notches. And having <span class="m">oiled</span> the first half—mold and its notches and the shell of the <span class="al">turtle</span>, and having also sprinkled it with <span class="m">spirits</span>, warm your <span class="m">water</span>, temper your sand with a bit of <span class="m">salt water</span>, <span class="m">ammoniac</span>, and the aforesaid <span class="m">hot water</span>, make your cast. Having taken hold, keep the sides of the two molds neatly together, and for each side secure the joints, which are not prone to do so naturally, with two clamps, so that when you uncover the bottom of the <span class="al">turtle</span> the top joint does not open. Then open the side with the belly and the throat, in the same manner that you would open a <span class="al">crayfish</span>, which is the hardest animal to mold of all animals that are molded in two parts.

> You can also mold your <span class="al">turtle</span> in one piece for each side, but you will need to burn it. And then to make the hollow, the recooked mold cannot be well—<span class="m">oiled</span> because it absorbs the <span class="m">oil</span>.
