## Orgues

 
Then they are affustés on a rather thick board close to each other and notches are made onto the board this way

. And through these notches is fit the harquebus’s hook which has a hole through which we pass, from under, <span class="m">iron</span> pegs. When you want to aim, you affuste the middle and side ones. If you want to make double, triple or four ranks or more, you have to put similar board rank one on the other, like the first one. This manner of making an orgue fait faute @ and makes it very stable. Because the other ones made of one massive and solid piece have cannons of only one and a half pan long. They therefore are used only for a salvo at an entrance or to protect a gate.
 
 A small hooked harquebus a—crocke weighs 40 <span class="ms">pounds</span> and is 4 <span class="ms">pans</span> long, and is to be loaded to the touch hole, its breech is three cannonballs thick, its front two.
 
 The double cannon is nothing different from the big ordinary cannon, apart from the fact that its cannonball has one <span class="ms">line</span> of thickness — or of diametre — more. A <span class="ms">line</span> is a <span class="ms">twelfth part</span> of a cannonball. At the breech, it has a thickess of one <span class="ms">line</span> more than the cannon, and the mouth is half a <span class="ms">line</span> thicker. Its load is six or seven <span class="ms">lbs</span> of <span class="m">powder</span>, more than a cannon, that is to say of two big linstocks. Its cannonball weighs 56 <span class="ms">lb</span>. Thirty <span class="al">horses</span> are necessary to carry it. It weakens the walls more than a cannon. But it is very uneasy to drive. This is why it is unused today and is more appropriate to be brought to a nearby place for close combat or for a <span class="x">ceremonial</span> entry, rather than for an ordinary execution. They are called basilics, and they are unmovable pieces.
