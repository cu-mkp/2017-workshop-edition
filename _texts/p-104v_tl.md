## Against dogs' mange

 
For normal—sized dogs, take half an ℥ of <span class="m">stavesacre</span>, & one ℥ for big dogs, as fine powder beaten with two <span class="m">egg whites</span> & one quarteron of <span class="m">oil</span>. They must drink the beverage on an empty stomach, after keeping them locked without any food. Approved.
 
 
  

## For casting

 
If you have some piece which does not want to release, & is big, mold it with <span class="m">wax</span>, either in cavity or in relief, because it is malleable once soft & obeys, and thus separates itself from the piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the <span class="m">melted wax</span> be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with <span class="m">wax</span> heated in <span class="m">hot water</span>, but in pressing the <span class="tl">mold</span>, it becomes gauche & becomes fake. Once your cavity in <span class="m">wax</span>, you can cast in some <span class="m">very soft clay</span> & very moistened & clear, & let it dry at ease. Then you will make a cavity on it <span class="del">ave</span> of <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>, in <span class="del">tu</span> which what you will form will be of good release.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Goldsmith</span>

 
Know what it is to work on spangled garments, it is small pieces of pure <span class="m">silver</span> & of <span class="m">silver—gilt</span> with which one makes the <span class="pro">archers'</span> coats.

Make an axle surrounded with wheels pierced all around in their thickness and attach feathers as for a cittern or a spinet & arrange them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable distance. And, turning the axle either by yourself or by a clock spring, your invention will effect itself.
