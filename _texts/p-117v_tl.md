## To make the ashes of <span class="pa">flowers</span> and <span class="pa">herbs</span> leave <span class="tl">molds</span>

 
Some people put <span class="m">quicksilver</span> inside. But, if it is a little work, or fine & delicate foliage, that only has a slender issue, they make two errors: the first, that <span class="m">quicksilver</span> by its heaviness can destroy some delicate tract inside in coming out, the other, that some bit will always linger inside that will make <span class="x">other</span> <span class="m">metals</span> sour & inhibit the perfection of the casting. It is true that if it is to empty the <span class="tl">mold</span> of some large animal that has big conduits & passages through which the <span class="m">quicksilver</span> can easily exit, like of a bird or a serpent, one can indeed put some amount of <span class="m">quicksilver</span> to break the calcinated bones of the animal in escaping, because of which the said <span class="m">☿</span> will empty out & not remain at all.

>   The <span class="pa">asparagus</span> stalk is so hard that most often it perseveres as charcoal. Because of this, do it rather dried out or wet it with <span class="m">sulfur oil</span> & <span class="m">turpentine</span>, or indeed cast the little branches separately & solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through with a wire.

Clean & blow to a fault, either with a soft <span class="tl">brush</span> or a clipped <span class="tl">brush</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="pa">Daisies</span>

 
They can be cast well in <span class="m">gold</span>. But if you want to <span class="m">enamel</span> them, you have to make them by hand & <span class="m">enamel</span> them & then attach them. Otherwise, the <span class="pa">leaves</span> would be so pressured that it would encrust the <span class="m">enamel</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> that has already been used

 
Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with <span class="m">stone allum</span>, you can use it in the mixture of other things & it can serve in place of <span class="m">brick</span>.
 
 
  

## Core <span class="tl">molding</span> <span class="m">wax</span> figures or <span class="m">lead</span> medals

 
Rub them with <span class="m">oil</span> with a <span class="tl">brush</span>. But be sure that it be so softly that your medal be barely wiped with it & that it hardly appear to have been greased. After rub it with <span class="m">spirits</span> and heat the <span class="m">water</span> with which you will wet your <span class="m">sand</span>, that of <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="m">brick</span> & <span class="m">alum</span>, so that being sort of lukewarm when you cast it, the <span class="m">oil</span> will not refuse it, as it does with cold water, & do not forget to moisten your <span class="m">sand</span> with it, mixing it always with a little <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>.

## <span class="m">Snakes' blood</span>

 
If you have to cut some snake inside a <span class="tl">mold</span> in order to burn it, cut it far from the intake of the <span class="tl">mold</span> so that no <span class="m">blood</span> at all remains, because it makes a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same <span class="m">quicksilver</span> & removes impressions from your <span class="tl">mold</span>.
