## <span class="m">Rouge clair</span> @ <span class="add"><span class="m">enamel</span></span>

 
<span class="m">Fine gold</span> is opposed to it, for <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> on this it remains yellowish. But alloyed <span class="m">gold</span> is more appropriate to it, such as that of <span class="cn">escu</span> & <span class="cn">pistolet</span>. <span class="del">If</span> <span class="m">Gold</span> <span class="del">f</span> <span class="del">is not put back on the fire</span> with its own pale color turns the <span class="m">enamel</span> a dead colour. <span class="del">Ma</span> And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back on the fire to give it a reddish color to make the <span class="m">enamels</span> beautiful. <span class="add">Otherwise, they are subdued.</span>
 
There is <span class="m">rouge clair</span> which, once it is worn down with <span class="m">arene</span>, loses its beauty.
 
There is some which has <span class="m">grains of gold</span> inside. And it is also the opinion of good <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> that the good one is made with <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
 
  

## Casting with <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Molds are recooked better & more surely than otherwise in a closed fire, such as a <span class="del"><span class="tl">pot</span></span> a <span class="tl">reverberatory furnace</span>. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some piece of important work <span class="del">d’<span class="m">or</span> e</span> that cost a lot to rough out in wax, they put the <span class="tl">molds</span> in a <span class="tl">pot</span> & recover them, & fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire that holds them unified & tight. Then, they recook <span class="tl">mold</span>, <span class="m">earth</span> & <span class="tl">pot</span> together and when everything is quite red, they cast the <span class="m">gold</span>. Fine <span class="m">gold</span> does not run well, but rather alloyed <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
<span class="m">Gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> do not become brittle: once entirely red and hot, dip them into <span class="m">water</span>.

## A way to make the gate for small female <span class="al">lizards</span>

 
Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is so delicate and thin that the <span class="del">casting scarcely</span> metal would flow with difficulty, especially when the tail is folded, roll <span class="m">wax</span> in little filaments of this size

 and apply some with the hot <span class="m">wire</span>, as said, one at the end of the tail & others that correspond in the same way, from one <span class="del">end</span> <span class="add">side</span> of the tail to the other, as you see depicted. But take heed to do it with the end of the <span class="tl">hot iron</span> so that the end of the <span class="m">wax</span> scarcely touches the animal, for the sand of the second gate will not touch this part. But make the end of the <span class="m">wax</span> arranges itself only at the end of the empty part of the first mold. Make as well channels of <span class="m">wax</span> around the legs &, around the contours of the body, which are a little long & they will serve as a trough for the molded thing.
