## To whiten the <span class="bp">face</span>

 
Pound <span class="m"><span class="pa">puffball</span></span> in <span class="m">cistern water</span>, and no other, and wash with this whitened <span class="m">water</span>. This is highly regarded. And I believe that making it from <span class="m"><span class="pa">wheat</span> starch</span> and using that would be even better.
 
 
  

## Against windiness, colic, etc.

 
<span class="m">Sap squeezed<span class="sup"> from <span class="pa">orange</span> peel</span></span> or <span class="m">water distilled from <span class="pa">orange</span> peel</span> is excellent against windy colics. <span class="m">Candied peel</span> is also excellent for <span class="bp">stomach</span> winds. And to try it, having poured <span class="m">sparkling wine</span> in a <span class="tl">glass</span>, press <span class="m"><span class="pa">orange</span> juice</span> on the <span class="m">wine's foam</span>, which comes only from vapor and wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also, if you squeeze <span class="m">juice</span> against a candle it will burn brighter. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pa">Eschervis</span> racine</span>

 
They want to be planted in a very humid place or such that, with <span class="sup">water from</span> wells or fountains, they can be frequently watered, because this makes them tender. Otherwise a hard core forms inside, which takes away all their goodness. 
 
 
  

## Against burns

 
Pound an <span class="m"><span class="pa">onion</span></span> with <span class="m">verjuice</span> and leave it to soak like this, then apply it. Or better, apply <span class="m">black soap</span> on the burn. Experimented. 
 
 
  

## A common saying

 
Steeple of <span class="pl">Rodez</span>, church of <span class="pl">Albi</span>, bells of <span class="pl">Mende</span>. However, the bell of <span class="pl">Toulouse</span> named Cardaillac is held to be one of the most beautiful in <span class="pl">France</span>, all the more since it weighs two hundred and fifty <span class="ms">quintal</span>s. 
 
 
  

## A form of regimen

 
Every <span class="tmp">morning</span>, take two or three <span class="m">eggs</span> laid on the same day or the <span class="tmp">day</span> before. Heat them up but do not cook them. Eat the <span class="m">yolk</span>s well dusted with <span class="m">sugar</span>. And afterwards drink one <span class="ms"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> of <span class="m">wine</span>. And in addition to being nourishing, it is good for the <span class="bp">stomach</span>.
