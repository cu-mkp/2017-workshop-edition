## Rose

 
Because the rose bloom is rather wavy, and its petals are all mixed up and arranged in various ways, it will not be beautiful if it is not painted, and you must also consider that its weight cannot supported by the <span class="m">tin</span> stem which is sour and fine. One moulds the flower of the rose in a separate mould, casting it thickly so that it comes out more easily. Then one cuts the cast at the edges of the stem of the bud, in which you graft and solder a stalk of brass wire to which you also solder the leaves. But because this <span class="m">tin</span>, being so thin, is hard to solder, and may melt some of the leaves and also the cast flowers; <span class="x">you should consider</span> that cast flowers, especially roses, are not beautiful without being painted, so one does not make the effort to solder them, but <span class="x">instead</span> one grafts the pieces that you want to join together and glues them with <span class="m">fish glue</span> that has been a little moistened and melted until thick. And so that it takes better, you heat the work in <span class="m">tin</span> lightly and for a long time, because if it is cold, the <span class="m">glue</span> will not take. Once your flower is thusly repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with some <span class="m">esbaucher wax</span>, which is a white <span class="m">wax</span> mixed with much wellâ€”ground <span class="m">ceruse,</span> or even better, <span class="m">white lead,</span> melting it and placing it on your work with a small warm bit of <span class="m">iron</span> needle. In the same way you can repair the little filaments that are in the middle of the rose, or the holes that may appear in some of the petals. Then paint your rose realistically. If you cast your rose in <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span>, you can also rejoin <span class="x">parts</span> and solder its. And in those materials, when you have join something very delicate together with the flower, such as a fly or other similar things, <span class="m">fish glue</span> is excellent, and holds very well, fixing it with a few little needles that act as nails. The leaves and buds can be cast in two molds that can be opened once they have been reheated, but not before. Then these things join up <span class="x">with the flower</span>.
