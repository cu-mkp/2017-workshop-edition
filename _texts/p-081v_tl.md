## Sand

 
Only <span class="m">brick</span> very finely sifted, & worn down one against another, is good for all castings of <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">copper</span>, mixed with <span class="m">urine</span>. It is necessary this be <span class="m">whitish brick</span>.
 
 
  

## Making <span class="m">copper</span> and <span class="m">latten</span> run

 
Put in, at the end, when it is very hot and you want to cast, <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> & <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, which removes <span class="m">filth</span> & heats it. Mix some <span class="m">ardides</span> with the <span class="m">latten</span>. @ Guard against the <span class="m">metal</span> touching the <span class="m">iron</span> or the <span class="m">latten</span> of the <span class="tl">box mold</span>, but cover it with <span class="m">sand</span> or <span class="m">lute</span>. Make the cast very even.
 
 
  

## Sand

 
<span class="m">Calcined black pebbles from the <span class="env">river</span></span> are good for <span class="m">lead</span>, but they are shaken loose for <span class="m">metal</span>.
 
There is only <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> <span class="m">clay earth with which one can make <span class="m">tiles</span></span>, reheated & reddened & passed through a <span class="tl">sleeve</span> finely moistened with <span class="m">glair</span>.
 
<span class="m"><span class="pa">Willow</span> charcoal</span> is excellent for sand for <span class="del">b</span> <span class="m">lead</span>.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> runs better.
 
 
  

## Casting with a <span class="tl">box mold</span>

 
It is good to make it with <span class="m"><span class="pa">boxwood</span></span>. Turn it in order to make it even, as this is important for the casting. <span class="m">Lute</span> also, or cover the mouth of the <span class="tl">box mold</span> with sand so that the melted <span class="m">metal</span>, or <span class="m">lead</span>,or <span class="m">copper</span> does not touch the <span class="tl">box mold</span>â€™s <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">latten</span>, because it makes it brittle, & makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always higher than the <span class="tl">mold</span>. Also guard against the cast being too wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big, the weight of the substance that runs breaks & shakes loose the <span class="tl">mold</span> & makes it porous. When you have cast, gently hit the <span class="tl">box mold</span> frame, so that the substance spreads better. <span class="m">Black lead of saulmon</span> from the first melting makes a very neat one.
