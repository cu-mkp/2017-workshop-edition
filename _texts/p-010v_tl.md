## For painting in <span class="m">oil</span> on <span class="m">taffeta</span> <span class="add">without the <span class="m">oil</span> running</span>

 
One needs to make a layer of <span class="m">batture</span>, which is made <span class="del">of well cooked honey & <span class="m">turpentine</span></span> of <span class="m">colle forte</span> soaked for 24 <span class="ms">hours</span> in <span class="m">water</span> then gently brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little <span class="m">honey</span> to soften it, & make it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <span class="m">oil</span>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve to make a ground layer for <span class="m">gold</span>. <span class="m">Water of alum</span> also keeps <span class="m">oil</span> from running.
 
 
  

## Ground layer for <span class="m">gold leaf</span> on <span class="m">parchment</span> or <span class="m">paper</span>

 
Make very clear <span class="m">starch glue</span>, showing no body. And make thereof six or five layers, & on the last, once it is half dried, apply your <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
 
  

## For cleaning <span class="m">gold leaf</span> applied to <span class="m">iron</span>

 
Rub your weapons or other gilt objects with <span class="m">dry <span class="al">horse</span> dung</span>.
 
 
  

## For whitening <span class="m">ceruse</span>

 
Hardâ€”boil <span class="m">eggs, divide them in half & take the yolk out, & between the two halves of the white</span> put a piece of <span class="m">ceruse</span>, & tie them together with <span class="tl">thread</span>. Then boil in <span class="m">clear water</span>, & it will become entirely black, & thus the <span class="m">ceruse</span> will be purified. Some reheat it over fire & it becomes very white.
