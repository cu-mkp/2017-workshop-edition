## <span class="tl">Files</span>

 
If they are not trempées à pacquet, that is, in the manner described, with <span class="m">soot</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, & <span class="m">vinegar</span>, they will not be good. The <span class="del">square</span> large <span class="tl">square files</span> used by <span class="pro">locksmiths</span> for their rough work are only made of <span class="m">doulx iron</span>, But the <span class="tl">soft files</span> must be made of <span class="m">steel</span>. <span class="pro">Founders</span> whose work is to repair <span class="m">latten</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> must have their <span class="tl">files</span> <span class="del">d</span> coarse otherwise they would fill up with the <span class="m">copper</span> which would make them smooth & soon render them useless. <span class="m">Latten</span>, which is more brittle, welcomes softer <span class="tl">files</span> than <span class="m">copper</span> does.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Oxen</span> foot bones for sand</span>

 
Once having been burned well twice & pulverized, they mold very neatly in sand & need not be reheated, but simply heated with the flame of <span class="m">straw</span>. But if you mold them in a noyau, give it its first layer, simple & very thin, with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, & leave to dry at ease. Next fortify the following layers with <span class="m">wadding</span> mixed with the said tempered <span class="m">bone sand</span>.

> 
>   It is the neatest sand that can be found for <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Huiles d'essence</span>

 
<span class="m"><span class="add"><span class="pa">Walnut</span></span> oil</span> mixed with as much of <span class="m">turpentine</span> & distilled by an <span class="tl">alembic</span> renders an essence whiter than <span class="m">common water</span>. But this has no body & does not give a bond for colors that are immediately imbibed, and then leaves the color without stickiness and faded. These, imbibed in this way, would not let you work or soften, no more than in <span class="m">distemper</span>. But you rectify this fault, by giving it a little body with <span class="m">turpentine</span>, not at all so thick as for varnish. And thus you can work with <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span> & will make a perfect <span class="m">lead white</span>. <span class="m">Turpentine varnish</span> made with this <span class="m">oil</span> is dry in one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span>.
