and with your pipes and abrevouers @, you can also place small threads of <span class="m">wax</span> which are applied to the body so that the <span class="m">metal</span> goes more easily from one part to another and runs quickly throughout. And with these pipes, you can guide your cast and your vents without having ruined anything.

 small rolls, you make your casts and vents without danger of chipping or <span class="x">...</span> any of the mold because the <span class="m">wax</span>, once it has been removed, leaves a thoroughly empty place. Make your vents proceed from the head <span class="x">of the cast</span>, which is at the bottom, towards the cast. Make your cast so that it is not thick, and make two or three notches inside the passage because this impairs the <span class="m">metal</span> fury. And it makes it flow easily without filling with bubbles, <span class="x">and</span> it does not make too much smoke which dams up the passage. You can also divide it into two or three branches thusly

## <span class="m">Plaster</span>

 
When you mold something in order to cast with <span class="m">wax</span>, first mold only <span class="m">plaster</span>, you mold with <span class="m">plaster</span> <span class="x">that is</span> only reheated after <span class="x">it</span> has been pulverized. Because, once <span class="x">it</span> has been reheated on the <span class="m">stone</span> slab, the outside is burnt, and the inside remains nearly unburnt. Transparent grey <span class="m">plaster</span> is not strong, but the good one <span class="x"><span class="m">plaster</span></span> becomes white once it has been soaked, and <span class="x">it</span> sets well quickly. Nevertheless I have found the grey <span class="x"><span class="m">plaster</span></span> to be quite firm and hard after it has set, but it takes longer <span class="x">to work with it</span>. Know the nature of each. You will never mold very neatly if you do not soak until it is quite clear and liquid, your <span class="m">plaster</span> or the core's <span class="m">sand</span>. Soak it straight away after it has been reheated.

>   However, if you mold with <span class="m">plaster</span> that has been reheated once as said, coat the first mold well with <span class="m">oil</span>. And when the second cast has set and you have prepared it, soak it in <span class="m">water</span> for a long time. And if it does not release, soak it in hot <span class="m">water</span>, because cold <span class="m">water</span> hardens it.
 
<span class="x">Something</span> to know
 
And hot <span class="m">water</span> softens it <span class="x"><span class="m">plaster</span></span> more than cold <span class="m">water</span> <span class="x">which</span> does not penetrate it <span class="x"><span class="m">plaster</span></span> as <span class="x">it does</span> <span class="m">mixed</span> <span class="m">plaster</span> because it <span class="x"><span class="m">plaster</span></span> is stronger and <span class="m">mixed plaster</span> is spongier. <span class="m">Medal</span>s are cast from this <span class="m">powder</span>ed, reheated <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="x">and the <span class="m">medal</span>s</span> will be waterproof as though they were <span class="m">varnish</span>ed. In Germany, people hang these <span class="m">medal</span>s on houses. See to it that the <span class="m">water</span> is very hot, and if the <span class="m">water</span> is boiling, it will not endanger <span class="x">it</span>. All molds <span class="x">made</span> of plaster only or molds <span class="x">made of</span> <span class="m">mixed</span> <span class="m">plaster</span> are stripped from it.
 
 
  

## Scimitars

 
<span class="pro">Workers</span> from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate <span class="m">iron</span> from the <span class="m">mine</span>s with <span class="m">steel</span>. And they cast the blades of the scimitar in <span class="m">sand</span> with this first <span class="m">steel</span> <span class="x">that was</span> first casted from its <span class="m">mine</span>. Afterwards, they <span class="x">the blades</span> cut other <span class="m">iron</span> without without great difficulty because all melted <span class="m">iron</span> is harder than soft <span class="m">iron</span> beaten into <span class="x">...</span> and bars. Thus is the <span class="m">steel</span> of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When someone takes the haft of a scimitar off, that person recognizes <span class="x">it</span> well by the tip in the haft which is cast in <span class="m">sand</span>.
 
 
  

## Hearing from afar

 
Make a small hole into the ground, put your ear against it during the night or during an equally quiet time, and you will easily hear the muffled sound.
