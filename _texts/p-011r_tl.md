## Painting <span class="m">esmail d’azur</span> in <span class="m">oil</span>

 
This is a secret that is hardly known to <span class="pro">common painters</span>. Some take the most delicate they can & grind it with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, which binds it, and next prick with an <span class="tl">awl</span> in several places the area they want to paint with <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span>, such that the <span class="m">oil</span> enters & leaks in, & <span class="add">ne</span> does not cause the <span class="m">azure</span>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat & put down the <span class="m">azure</span> on it, which is also done à destrempe. The main thing is to grind it well on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it <span class="del">with</span> thoroughly with an <span class="m">egg yolk</span> & then wash it in five or six <span class="tl"><span class="tl"><span class="m">waters</span></span></span> and lay it on not with a <span class="tl">painceau</span>, which would be too soft, but with a <span class="tl">broisse</span> thoroughly softened & crimped, & laying it on thickly as if one were putting it down with a <span class="tl">trowel</span>; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that grinding <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span> with <span class="m">egg yolk</span> & next washing it in several <span class="tl"><span class="m">waters</span></span> is good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it. I have also washed it in several <span class="tl"><span class="m">waters</span></span> &, when it had settled a little, I removed the <span class="tl"><span class="m">water</span></span>, still <span class="del">q</span> blue, with a <span class="tl">sponge</span> and squeezed it into another <span class="tl">vessel</span> <span class="del">thus</span> <span class="add">where it settled, & from the residue</span> I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the <span class="m">azure</span> without grinding it, which is the best, for in the grinding of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in <span class="pl">Germany</span> compound it like <span class="m">enamel</span>, in large pieces which they pestle, & pass through several <span class="tl">sieves</span> & wash.
 
To make <span class="m">azures</span> beautiful, they wash or soak them in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">rock water</span></span>, as they call it; it is a <span class="m">water</span> distilled from mines where <span class="m">azure</span> or <span class="m">vert d'azur</span> is found, which distills naturally through the <span class="env">veins of the mountain</span> or is distilled through an <span class="tl">alembic</span> <span class="del">par</span> from mineral stones of <span class="m">azure</span> or <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
<span class="m"><span class="add">Azure</span> ash</span> are only good for landscapes because they die in <span class="m">oil</span>. Only true <span class="m">azure</span> holds on. <span class="m">Azur d’esmail</span> cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingernail</span></span> or the <span class="tl"><span class="m">oil</span> palette</span>. If it <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with the <span class="m">egg yolk</span> or, better yet, wash it in <span class="tl"><span class="m">clear water</span></span> & with a <span class="tl">sponge</span> remove the <span class="tl"><span class="m">colored water</span></span> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work with.
