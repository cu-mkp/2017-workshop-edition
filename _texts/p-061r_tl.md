and even it well <span class="del">then</span> and once quite dry, they draw their picture & layer their natural flesh color, leaving the space for shadow, like the side of the forehead, & the cheek, & the area around the eyes blank & dry until they have filled in the rest. Next they put their shadows separately, which they do not make as dark as they could not naturally be. In sum, they do not put shadow on flesh color nor flesh color on shadow, but white on white & black on black <span class="del">Thus</span> & each on their own. In this way their work is neat & the colors do not die.
 
 
  

## Flesh colors

 
You need to make two kinds of it, one more red to make the main layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as around the eyes. And then on this last flesh color, you will lightly touch the main daylight with a little <span class="m">lead white</span>. But avoid putting too much of it for this will look like the face of a dead person. The beautiful <span class="m"><span class="pl">Florence</span> lake</span> makes a beautiful vivid flesh color that approaches <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> the complexion of <span class="m">rose alexandrine</span> & <span class="m">incarnadine</span>.

## Rounding off

 
If you want to highlight well, <span class="del">arr</span> soften round things by rounding them off with the <span class="tl">point of the pinceau & the rest with the flat part</span> if it is flat, & thus for the others according to their nature, & lightly with the <span class="tl">point of the dry & flattened pinceau</span> <span class="add">&</span> with patience.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lead white</span>

 
Without this, you cannot work on a small scale for which one needs to soften with great care. But you cannot do it with <span class="m">ceruse</span> because it does not have enough body.
 
 
  

## Lights

 
Your <span class="tl">pinceau</span> shows it to you by casting a shadow which must always follow the <span class="bp">back of your hand</span>, not in a straight line like this,

 for the light would be too crude & too harsh, but obliquely & as if at an incline, thus:

 The panel needs to not be facing the <span class="env">light</span> head—on, but half turned against it. And above all look for a soft light, for it makes soft both the shadow & the work, like a harsh light <span class="sup">makes</span> a harsh work.
