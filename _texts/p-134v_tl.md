##  To make <span class="m">gold</span> fluid 

 
 Put as much <span class="m">verdigris</span> as <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, as much <span class="m">borax</span> as <span class="m">saltpeter</span>. But don't add a greater quantity of <span class="m">borax</span> and <span class="m">saltpeter</span> than half the quantity of <span class="m">verdegris</span> and <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, in fact add as much <span class="m">borax</span> and <span class="m">saltpetre</span> all together as <span class="m">verdigris</span>. Grind into powder the ingredients on the <span class="m">marble</span> slab, then grind again with very good <span class="m">vinegar</span> until it is very fine, like a ground color, grind <span class="m">verdigris</span> with <span class="m">oil</span>, then leave to dry if you have time, if you haven't so much time dry it with the fire of the forge, make so that it is very dry.

##  Casting big works with <span class="m">gold</span>

 
 Not only should one clamp the mold very well, but also strengthen it with good iron wire links or adequate straps.

## Secret for soldering small works made of <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>

 
 If some little pieces of legs cannot be easily removed from <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span> casting, it is because you didn't cast <span class="m">wax</span> under these parts. Beat some soldering <span class="m">gold</span> very finely, then cut it into very fine flakes, cut the quantity you need. Take some of this phlegm or white and thick <span class="m">saliva</span> which is on the teeth, put some of this matter to the place you want to solder with the point of a burin, then place your flakes, then put to the opposite part a mixture made of a small quantity of soaked fat <span class="m">earth</span>and <span class="m">saliva</span>, thanks to the mixture the solder will better adhere. Then pulverize a bit of <span class="m">borax</span> on it, and heat up <span class="m">Quince pulp seed water</span> to a boil and others too.
