## Sand, <span class="m">slate</span>, and <span class="m">burned earth</span>

 
Very burnt sand loses its bond. <span class="m">Slate</span> is reheated & molds neatly. Next, it is true that often it becomes porous, like <span class="m">burned earth</span> also does, like <span class="m">fat sand</span> also does.

## <span class="m">Magistra</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> take the <span class="m">roots of a young <span class="pa">elm</span></span> when it has sap, & boil it in <span class="m">wine</span>, or better yet <span class="m">vinegar</span>, and keep it <span class="tmp">all year long</span> in a <span class="tl">cask</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand from the <span class="env">mine</span> of <span class="pl">Thoulouse</span></span>

 
 Casting sand coming from the <span class="env">mine</span>, once passed through a <span class="tl">double sieve</span>, next put in with <span class="m">melted resin</span>, burns & inflames & becomes all red & inflamed like <span class="m">iron</span>. Once cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>. Thus having prepared it & render it without asperity on the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingernail</span></span>, I moistened it with <span class="m">beaten egg glair</span> & beat it well, until it was not pasty but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, & molded with it in <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> very neatly, but it wants to be well reheated & at ease.
 
Others beat it well in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>, in small amounts at a time, & thus it detaches and renders very finely. Then they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Then they grind it dry on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>. And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not too dried out, <span class="del">it</span> and it retains body & bond of the <span class="m">earth</span> of which it is related, and is better than when it is very burnt. Once moistened with <span class="m">egg glair wiped with a <span class="tl">sponge</span></span>, it releases <span class="del">very neatly M</span> very neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore, since then I experimented <span class="del">lexper</span> with moistening it only with very strong <span class="m">vinegar</span>. It released a figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that, moistening the finest in the same way like with <span class="m">glair</span> & the lumpiest, to fill the chasses with <span class="m">salt water</span> or <span class="m">wine</span>, that they do not ally so well. Since they are of the same nature & are moistened the same, they embrace each other, & hold together one with the other.
 
 To mold well, after having prepared your sands, mold <span class="tmp">in a day</span>. Slowly reheat them <span class="tmp">the next day</span>, then cast them on another.

>   One ought to choose the one which is usually <span class="del">as</span> in clods & lumps, well <span class="env">deep in the earth</span>, for usually the one that is found <span class="env">above</span> has too much <span class="m">earth</span>, and the deep one is similar to <span class="m">rock</span>.

>   I have molded with it in <span class="m">pure lead</span> very <span class="del">neatly</span> hot, & I had as an example the first very neat one, but the <span class="m">vinegar</span> hardly gives it any bond, & thus it withstood only one cast.
