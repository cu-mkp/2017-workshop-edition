## @For making <span class="m">millas</span>

 
You must have some <span class="m">millet</span> soaked in order to remove the <span class="m">chaff</span> and then clean it well. Next you must <span class="tl">grind</span> it again quite finely and pass through a cloth <span class="tl">sieve</span>. One must soak the <span class="m">flour</span> with fresh melted <span class="m">butter</span> and some <span class="m">milk</span> so that it is very light, like the <span class="m">pastry</span> to make <span class="m">beignets</span>, and add <span class="m">egg yolk</span> depending on the amount of <span class="m">flour</span>, so that there are two <span class="m">egg yolks</span> for each <span class="m">millas</span>. Then you will put in some <span class="m"><span class="pa">saffron</span></span> if you want to give them a little colour.
 
Afterwards you must have some <span class="tl">mold</span>s, which must be made from <span class="m">terra<span class="sup">cotta</span></span>, in the shape of the bottom of the catholic hat, but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a good fire, clean where you want to put your <span class="m">millas</span> and then take your <span class="tl">mold</span>s and grease them very well so that the <span class="m">pastry</span> does not stick to them when baked. Once you have done that, put your <span class="tl">mold</span>s in a place in the <span class="tl">oven</span> where you clean and sprinkle a bit of <span class="m">flour</span> on the bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned <span class="m">pastry</span>. Then you will cover the said <span class="tl">mold</span>s, with a <span class="tl">lid</span> made like the <span class="tl">mold</span>, but it must be bigger and not open at the top. Then once done, you will put some <span class="m">straw</span> on the said <span class="tl">lid</span> and a lot of hot <span class="m">charcoal</span>, and set a fire around it, once done, you will open up one of them after a bit of time and will see when it is baked, it will be hard.
 
 
  

## @<span class="pro">Glazier</span>

 
<span class="m">Glass from <span class="pl">Lorraine</span></span> is smoother & more even than <span class="m">plate glass</span> and it is sturdier & more durable. But commonly it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens because the <span class="pro">glassmakers</span>, having made it, put it when totally hot on <span class="m"><span class="pa">straw</span></span>, which stains it in this way. However, this is removed with <span class="m">varnish</span> & <span class="m">salt</span> & other <span class="m">drugs</span> that the <span class="pro">glaziers</span> put in. <span class="m">Glass from <span class="pl">Lorraine</span></span> is sold by <span class="ms">lien</span> & each <span class="ms">lien</span> is composed of three <span class="ms">tablets</span>. The <span class="ms">lien</span> costs usually x <span class="cn">sous</span>. <span class="m">Plate glass</span> <span class="del">sold in</span> is made in <span class="pl">France</span>, it is whiter & clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from <span class="pl">Lorraine</span>. It is also commonly blown & in that case, it is better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the shape of the frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very evenly.
