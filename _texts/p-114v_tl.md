This thus prepared, place your <span class="del">de</span> first half—<span class="tl">mold</span> on the tourtelle of <span class="del"><span class="m">earth</span></span> <span class="m">clay</span>, & put the circle also around, & make the mark for the thickness similar to the first. Then, with another rather thick <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, moisten well everywhere the uncovered half <span class="del">& le ventre</span> of your animal <span class="del">Et</span> <span class="add">with <span class="m">eau de vye</span></span>, without leaving anything, if it is possible, which is not moistened, for this is the secret, which makes it come out neat. And next, as promptly as possible, before the <span class="m">eau de vye</span> <span class="del">ne</span> evaporates, wet your sand, and throw it, in shakes, and while blowing, & moving the <span class="tl">mold</span>, as you did for the first one, making sure that the <span class="del">premier q</span> first thing you pour on the animal should be a little clearer than the next one, so that it moistens everywhere &retrace the more delicate parts. So, leave it for a <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">quarter hour</span></span> to set, then remove the circle & the <span class="m">clay</span> tourtelle. And, with a <span class="tl">knife</span>, arrange your two <span class="tl">molds</span> uniformly together in a long shape of a <span class="mu">mandore</span>, as mentioned, because of the cast. Then dip a little the whole <span class="tl">mold</span> evenly, at the level of the joints, in <span class="m">water</span>, for this is another secret to disjoint them, otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore by this mean, and next, extract gently & with patience and immediacy the half of the animal remaining in one of the <span class="tl">molds</span>, <span class="del">for</span> pulling it sometimes from one side & sometimes from the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from your <span class="tl">mold</span>. <span class="del">Et</span> The latter being empty, <span class="del">retire</span> rejoints the two halves so that no dust enters it, & put them aside until you want to reheat them, make a cast & vents, & place <span class="tl">clamps</span>. As for the animal, so that it does not dry & that you might be able to mold it four of five times, put in in <span class="m">water</span>. And I think that it would keep even better in <span class="m">eau de vye</span>. However, the best would be to mold in the same <span class="tmp">day</span> the 4 or 5 <span class="tl">molds</span> that you can do, because these infected animals themselves are <span class="sn">stinky</span> in one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">day</span></span>. Having left your <span class="tl">molds</span> one or two <span class="del">es</span> <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span> to dry, for they stay damp for a good <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">month</span></span>, make the vents on one half.

>   If after both halves of the noyau have made a strong & hard set, you would not dip your <span class="tl">mold</span> in <span class="m">water</span>, it would not disjoin at all. But as you dip the reverse of the <span class="tl">mold</span> in <span class="m">water</span>, the imbibed <span class="m">oil</span> collects at the top & at the level of the joints & and makes it separate.

>   However, take heed your second <span class="tl">mold</span> be of good thickness & that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having dipped it in <span class="m">water</span>, & you want to open it, there is a risk that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open it, dip all of it in <span class="m">water</span>, <span class="add">and rub it everywhere</span>, where it will harden if it has set well.Then, take your two <span class="tl">molds</span>, joined with a <span class="tl">rough <span class="m">linen</span> cloth</span>, in in order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you wanted to quarter a loaf of <span class="m">bread</span>. But if happens to break, join it & on the reverse, strenghten the joints with <span class="tl">clamps</span>.
