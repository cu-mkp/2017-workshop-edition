One needs to make at least three layers of flesh color to accomplish faces in <span class="m">oil</span>. And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber where it is appropriate. Next, the heightening with <span class="m">lead white</span> must not be put on the black. Flesh colors and  with <span class="m">ceruse</span> going in will yellow in five or six <span class="tmp">months</span>, but <span class="m">lead white</span> does not change.
 
<span class="m"><span class="pl">Florence</span> lake</span> is better than the kind from <span class="pl">Flanders</span> for in <span class="pl">Florence</span> the best dyes are made. To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest & liveliest <span class="m">lake</span> is the best, for the kind that contains <span class="m"><span class="m">purpurine</span></span> & violet, by admixture of too much <span class="m">alum</span>, makes flesh color like that of one who is very cold. That is why ladies, wanting to color their <span class="bp">cheeks</span>, ground <span class="m"><span class="pl">Florence</span> lake</span> very finely, then fill a little <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">cotton</span></span></span> with it, which they next wrap in a little <span class="tl"><span class="m">fabric of <span class="pl">Cambray</span></span></span> which is clear. And thus they pounce the <span class="m">lake</span> on their <span class="bp">cheeks</span> & then, with another clean <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">cotton</span></span></span>, they soften it.
 
<span class="m">Cristallin</span> having been ground with <span class="m">water</span> appears to <span class="del">be</span> have body, but with <span class="m">oil</span> it does not have any. It is ground with <span class="m">lake</span> & with <span class="m">asphaltum</span>, which would not dry for a <span class="tmp">very long time</span> without this.
 
<span class="m"><span class="pa">Spike lavender</span> oil</span> is commonly put with <span class="m">lead white</span>, <span class="del">d</span> not entirely pure but mixed with a little <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span>. The said <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> would not be good for <span class="m">lake</span> & colors that do not have body <span class="add">for it would make them crack</span>, but with those that have body & are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.
 
<span class="m">Verdigris</span> and <span class="m">orpiment</span> must first be ground with <span class="m">urine</span> rather than thinning them with <span class="m">oil</span>. Thus they are beautiful & do not die.
