*[continued]*
  
 light, pull out the <span class="m">hairs</span> which make the tip too long with the <span class="bp">ends of your fingernails</span>, and this until the tip seems good to you, & and until you notice in it the <span class="m"><span class="al">rat</span> hairs</span> which are entirely black & the <span class="m">hair of the <span class="al">petitâ€”gris</span></span> is <span class="del">at the</span> whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind <span class="del">b</span> and tighten it very well with a <span class="tl">thread</span> in two places, then cut the excess & fit it in a <span class="m">quill</span> of a convenient size for it, of a <span class="al">duck</span> or a <span class="al">crow</span> for the small ones. Good <span class="tl">pinceaulx</span> are those that, once soaked in <span class="m">water</span>, do not bulge when you trace on your <span class="bp">hand</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Oil</span>

 
All <span class="m">oil</span> which is imbibed by <span class="m">paper</span> & once heated by fire evaporates & leaves the <span class="m">paper</span> clean, like <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>, is good for making <span class="m">varnish</span>.
 
 
  

## Sand

 
Everything ground & tempered becomes porous, according to some.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Bellows furnace</span>

 
Before you put in the <span class="m">metal</span>, it is necessary that it be red at the bottom, like like a <span class="m">charcoal</span> & well inflamed. Next, you <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> fill it & cover the <span class="m">charcoal</span> & adjust the <span class="tl">bellows</span>, otherwise the <span class="m">metal</span> on top would melt as a result of the <span class="tl">bellows</span> & its bottom would be curdled & cooled & would not run. But if you proceed in this manner you will melt everything you like.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span> on <span class="m">paper</span>

 
The <span class="pl">Germans</span> make boxes <span class="del">p</span> covered with painted <span class="m">paper</span> & varnish it with <span class="m">glair of the egg</span> mixed with <span class="m">gum</span> & a little <span class="m"><span class="m">oil</span>, not of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span>, but another <span class="sn">odorant</span> that resembles <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive</span> oil</span></span>. Every work done with <span class="m">glair</span> supports <span class="m">oil</span>. It is with this that <span class="pro">painters</span> trick the <span class="pro">poor peasants</span>, painting their bands of <span class="m">taffeta</span> with this <span class="m">glair</span>, to be done sooner. But <span class="env">the first rain</span> carries away everything.
