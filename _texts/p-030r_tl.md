## <span class="m">Lead</span>

 
The best, fattest & softest is brought from <span class="pl">Germany</span> and is not in saulmon, but in lattes, of around an <span class="ms"><span class="bp">arm</span></span> long & three <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> wide. It is transported to <span class="pl">Lyon</span>, and from this, the leaf is made for small mirrors in <span class="pl">Nuremberg</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Pewterer</span>

 
They also make their <span class="tl">molds</span> out of <span class="m">metal</span> which last longer & mold more cleanly than <span class="m">grais</span>, because the vessel comes out without fins & smooth. But this is for the <span class="pro">rich</span> because a <span class="tl">mold</span> costs fifteen or sixteen <span class="cn">frans</span>. They are mainly made of <span class="m">metal</span>, for basins & ewers & salt cellars & similar things which are fashioned.
 
For pints, <span class="tl">molds</span> are made with <span class="m">white clay</span> mixed with <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span> dung</span> & <span class="m">cloth waste</span> & well beaten, because the pints, being deep halfâ€”circles, would not easily release from the <span class="tl"><span class="m">grais</span> mould</span>, unlike the <span class="m">earth</span> ones, which are soft. One makes the noyau of the <span class="tl">mold</span> of the said pints in grais.
 
In <span class="tl">metal molds</span>, one makes vents and casts all at once, which is the cause that in the middle of the dish, no smoky black line which comes from the vapor & smoke of the <span class="m">metal</span> that is cast, which is the cause that in that spot, the work is lumpy & very often pierced. However they repair it with <span class="m">soldering</span> <span class="del">du n</span>, as is said. This smoke is made right in the middle of the cast, & in <span class="tl"> molds of <span class="m">grais</span></span>.
 
The vessel can be <span class="tl">hammered</span> <span class="del">mar</span> to make it more vendable. But it will not last as long.
 
Depending on the size of their dishes & plates, they have notches on the spoke of their <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wheels</span>. And when they want to apply
