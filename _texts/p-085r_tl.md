*[continued]*
  
to rest on a <span class="tl">very clean & smooth table</span>, & since it is desiccative, I knew it would dry out <span class="del">lor</span>, what I let it do in order to reduce it to powder, & molding it with sand, once broken up with my <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> & the sharp edge of a <span class="tl">knife</span>. I <span class="m">oiled</span> my medal because <span class="m">oil</span> cleans it without spoiling it. <span class="del">And</span> And having dried it & cleaned it with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span></span>, & <span class="tl">small bristle brushes of <span class="al">pork</span></span>, I once again lightly <span class="m">oiled</span> it with <span class="m">clear <span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span>, & gently passed a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span></span> over it, so that it does not remain too <span class="m">oiled</span>, and I noted that, in this way, it would come out better in release, because the <span class="m">ceruse</span>, once moistened with <span class="m">water of egg glair</span>, would not attach to the <span class="m">oil</span>. This worked very well and I molded a medal of high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of good sands, such as <span class="m">felt</span>, <span class="m">burnt bone</span> & <span class="m">iron dross</span>, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it & my <span class="tl">mold</span> became hard like <span class="m">marble</span>, and I realized with this, that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some <span class="m">water</span>, which gives them body & compactness, like <span class="m">egg glair</span>, <span class="m">gummed water</span>, <span class="del">ea</span> <span class="m">wine boiled with <span class="pa">elm root</span></span>, & and lightly <span class="m">oil</span> the medal, it withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as <span class="m">glass</span>. But even <span class="m">soft lead</span> & <span class="m">brittle tin</span> <span class="del">v</span> want to be cast very hot.
 
Since then I have realized that this sand, even though it is excellent & endures many castings & molds very neatly, it is however fat and makes things porous. This, <span class="m">soft lead</span> <span class="del">and the</span> does not come out so well. But try to mix it with a <span class="m">lean sand</span>, such as <span class="m">pumice</span>, <span class="m">flakes</span>, & similar things, to give them body, & so that they release better. For <span class="m">lean sands</span> barely release well and yet they receive <span class="m">metal</span> well.

## <span class="m">Green varnish</span> for medals of <span class="m">copper</span>

 
Having casted them very neatly, cover them with <span class="m">sel de verre</span> that we use for sand, & moisten it, & in three or 4 <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span> it will be green. Oil them after & keep them under the <span class="m">dung</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Glue</span>

 
The <span class="pl">Flemish</span> reglue their <span class="tl"><span class="m">earthen</span> pots</span> with gold color, that is to say <span class="m">minium</span>, <span class="m">massicot</span>, & <span class="m">varnish</span>.
