## Fanciful tables

 
You can make various grooved compartments & on these, paint <span class="al">fishes</span> naturally & with color on <span class="m">simple carton</span> & if you wish, on <span class="m">silvered & <span class="tl">burnished</span> paper</span> to represent the scales. And next, cover them with <span class="m">very clear lantern horn</span>. You can apply the very same to other works.
 
 
  

## Planting <span class="pa">trees</span>

 
 One needs to plant them in a <span class="del"><span class="env">dry place</span></span> <span class="env">dry weather</span>, & plenty of earth gathered at the foot all around, like a mound, so that the <span class="env">rains</span> do not fill the holes & drown the <span class="pa">trees</span>.
 
 
  

## Casting

 
I have tried four kinds of sand for <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>: <span class="m">chalk</span>, <span class="m">crushed glass</span>, <span class="m">tripoli</span> & <span class="m">burnt linen</span>, all four excellent. But as for the <span class="m">chalk</span>, it needs to be of the softest kind you can find, like <span class="m">the <span class="pl">Champagne</span> one that <span class="pro">painters</span> use</span>. It releases very neatly, does not need to be moistened with <span class="m">magistra</span> or anything else, but needs to be completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized. The first cast is always the neatest, however it will well withstand two or three. But there is only the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake your <span class="tl">box mold</span> to take new <span class="m">powdered chalk</span> that has not yet been used for works, for the one previously used in the box mold has dried out & has no stickiness & bond like the fresh one. <span class="m">Crushed glass</span> can be made from <span class="m">common glass sand, however cristallin</span> is more excellent, for <span class="m">common glass</span> contains <span class="del"><span class="m">glass</span></span> <span class="m">salt of saltwort</span> only, but <span class="m">cristallin</span> contains both <span class="m">salt of tartar</span> & <span class="m">saltwort</span> all together, which both help fusion, the <span class="m">glass</span> once calcined & reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to calcine it perfectly, throw your <span class="m">glass</span>, lumps of whichever sort, among the largest possible lit <span class="m">charcoals</span> that you can, if you are lacking some other <span class="del">t</span><span class="add">d</span>e foeu<span class="del">t</span> violent heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into <span class="m">water</span>.
