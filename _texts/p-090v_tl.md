good & proper for molding. For if it is big, pass it through a <span class="tl">sieve</span>, and if it is not yet fine enough, wash it, & when the <span class="m">water</span> will be a little rested, empty the one which is still troubled in some separate <span class="tl">vessel</span>. The big ones will fall down quickly to the bottom of the first <span class="tl">vessel</span>, but the one which will have come from the troubled <span class="m">water</span>, placed separately, having taken residence, will be very fine. And then, if it does not have enough bond, grind it well dry on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, & you will render it impalpable, & which will have bond just like <span class="m">chalk</span>. Then, if it seems to need it, you will reheat it, & will crush it again & mix it with <span class="m">salts</span>, or <span class="m">linen, <span class="add">or</span> burned felt</span> or <span class="m">ashes of paper</span> & similarly washed things.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Terre fondue of <span class="pro">potters</span></span>

 
Grind it in a <span class="del"><span class="tl">mortar</span></span> <span class="add"><span class="tl">mustard mill</span></span> with some <span class="m">water</span>, & and render it impalpable, dry it & next moisten it with <span class="m">salt water</span>, which gives strength to <span class="del">u</span> all sands to withstands several casts.
 
 
  

## Orange trees

 
In Italy, <span class="sup">particularly</span> in the coldest areas like Lombardia, people plant the orange trees inside squared <span class="m">wood</span> planters. The planters are larger at the bottom than at the top. People make handles on each side, where they attach straps in order to carry the planter, like one carries the gout sufferers, because if one used wheels to roll them one would damage the garden's paths. Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut & trim the ends of the orange tree's roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the <span class="m">wood</span> <span class="x">of the planter</span>, tighten on it & they double over themselves & the ends dry & the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space <span class="del"></span> to expand, without encountering resistance from the <span class="m">wood</span> <span class="sup">of the planter</span>. That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws & not with nails, to avoid shaking the <span class="m">soil</span> when one opens them.
