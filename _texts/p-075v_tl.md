## For making gray <span class="m">wood</span>

 
One needs to take three <span class="ms">half setiers</span> of <span class="m">iron filings</span> for xviii <span class="del">s</span> <span class="ms">deniers</span> of <span class="m">alung de glace</span>, & for as much <span class="m">green copperas</span>, for six <span class="ms">deniers</span> of <span class="m">verdigris</span>, <span class="m">pitch</span>, & a <span class="ms">quart</span> of <span class="del">cuyr</span> <span class="m"><span class="pro">currier</span> water</span>, and if you cannot find it, you will put <span class="del">more</span> <span class="add"><span class="m">rainwater</span></span>  of slight degree. 
 
 
  

## For <span class="m">gilding</span> on <span class="m">wood</span>

 
First one needs to lay down a coat of <span class="m">glue very clear</span>, and once dry, you will lay down a coat of <span class="m">yellow gold</span>. And when it is done, you will take <span class="m"><span class="pa">fig tree</span> wood</span>, & put it to soak some space of time, & wash the places you want to <span class="m">gild</span>, and cut your <span class="m">gold</span> with a <span class="tl">knife</span> to the price that you will lay down. And one must lay down the said <span class="m">gold</span> with <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">cotton</span></span></span>. And if you can find <span class="m">fig tree</span>, take the <span class="m">the white of one egg</span> & stir it vigorously.
 
 If your <span class="m">gold</span> does not have beautiful enough color, you will take a <span class="m"><span class="al">partridge</span> feather</span>, & make it burn it in a<span class="tl"> chafingâ€”dish</span>, and make the smoke go against what you have <span class="m">gilded</span>.
 
 
  

## For <span class="m">gilding</span> with <span class="m">or moulu</span>

 
One needs to take a <span class="ms">coquille</span> of <span class="m">gold</span> and, before you want to work with it, you will soak it with <span class="m">gum water</span> and lay it down with a <span class="tl">pinsseau</span>, & polish it with a <span class="del">skin</span> <span class="tl"><span class="al">wolf</span>'s tooth</span> once it is dry.
 
 
  

## Recipe for putting all <span class="m">woods</span> in color

 
For making it black, one needs to soak it in <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive</span> oil</span>. And the <span class="m">horn</span>, in a similar case, four or five <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>, & then boil it there where it has soaked for the space of one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span>, & take it out of the <span class="m">oil</span>, and take some <span class="m">natural sulphur</span> or another
