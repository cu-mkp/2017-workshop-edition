<span class="m">Lake</span> & <span class="m">lead white</span> & <span class="m">ceruse</span> are easy to work in <span class="m">oil</span>, but every kind of <span class="m">azure</span> is difficult. And to make beautiful <span class="m">azure</span>, one needs to layer it not with large strokes of the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> but with small strokes of the point. Not only <span class="m">ash <span class="sup">from <span class="pl">Acre</span></span></span> & <span class="m">azure d’Acre</span> but mainly <span class="m">azur d’esmail</span> which one needs to choose to be very delicate, <span class="del">for it</span> otherwise you will not <span class="del">v</span> be able to work with it except with great work, and even then you need to thin it with <span class="m">turpentine</span> to give it body, and mix it with a little <span class="m">lead white</span>. Any <span class="m">azure</span> does not want to be ground or washed for it loses color & becomes wan. But putting it powdered on your <span class="tl">palette</span>, you will thin it little by little either with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> or <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, dipping a <span class="tl">knife point</span> in <span class="m">oil</span>, then tempering it little by little on the said <span class="tl">palette</span>.

 
  

## Shadows

 
The first shadows which are closer to light need to be clear & thoroughly softened & then the last ones very dark to accentuate well. The <span class="pl">Italians</span> usually make three shadows, the first one, of light, very clear, the second one darker & the third ones quite strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the clearest.

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Azure</span> is more beautiful when imbibed on the panel <span class="del">without</span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> with which it has been first thinned, without putting in <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>. And if you want to know if it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine, thus appearing to be well—imbibed. If not it will shine
 
<span class="m">Azur d'esmail </span> <span class="del">imbibed in <span class="m">oil</span></span> distempered in <span class="m">oil</span>, leaves it & returns to its first nature if you dip it in <span class="m">water</span>.
 
Colors for working in miniature want to be thoroughly ground, & work them with a point of a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> if you want your work to be well—softened.
