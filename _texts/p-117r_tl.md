## A way to mold <span class="pa">flower</span>s and <span class="pa">herb</span>s

 
It is necessary to choose them in full bloom and color, and not pick them, if possible, until the time one wants to mold them so that they will not wilt. Or if you need to carry them from afar, put their stems in a bottle of <span class="m">water</span>, or better still <span class="m">wine</span>. First make a <span class="m">wax</span> stick pointed like a big peg, of a size appropriate to what you want to cast, as you see in the margin, marked A. At the bottom of this peg, put and prick a bit of <span class="m">iron</span> wire, rather thick and strong. And at the point of this <span class="sup">peg</span>, you will fit your <span class="pa">flower</span> stem or your <span class="pa">herb</span>. This done, set it aside. Arrange your <span class="m">clay</span> circle and outline as you did for the <span class="al">snake</span>s, in the shape of a <span class="mu">mandore</span> according to the size of your <span class="pa">herb</span>. Then take the <span class="pa">herb</span> you have prepared to be cast, as we have taught you, and wet and moisten it carefully with good <span class="m">eau de vie</span> with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>. Then place the wire end through the end of the <span class="m">earthen</span> <span class="mu">mandore</span>, so that the <span class="m">wax</span> peg, where the <span class="pa">herb</span> is, joins itself to the edge of the <span class="m">earthen</span> <span class="mu">mandore</span>. And arrange your <span class="pa">herb</span> lying flat so that it remains in the middle of said <span class="mu">mandore</span>, without touching on any side, such that the sand that you pour in it will be of equal thickness everywhere, and will be <span class="add">more than</span> two good <span class="ms">finger</span>s higher than your <span class="pa">plant</span> everywhere on top. And having secured the wire well, quickly pour your <span class="m">wet sand</span>, much clearer than the one used for snakes, in the <span class="mu">mandore</span>, and the sooner the better, so that the <span class="m">eau de vie</span> does not dry. And be sure to put in a little more <span class="m">water of sal ammoniac</span> among the common than you do for the snakes. And if you were to make sand especially for casting your bouquets, where you would mix in a little more <span class="m">feather alum</span>, it will be all the better. In this way, your mold will be in one piece and it will not be necessary to disassemble it, but to separate it from the <span class="m">clay</span> once it will have set. Let it dry. And then fire it again until the herbs are burnt. Note that if the herb you want to cast has a strong stalk and stem, you can cast it lying down, as said. But if it is fine and delicate, plant it standing up with the <span class="m">wax</span> peg so that the sand will always raise it up, it being very clear. Do not forget to arrange two vent holes with two small <span class="tl">stick</span>s, which will start at the bottom of the cast, which is the pointed end of the <span class="m">wax</span> peg.
