## Casting in three frames

 
You can cast <span class="m">bronze</span> mortars and similar things which release well in three frames. That is to say the body of the mortar in one, its noyau in the other, and the base of the mortar in the third one, because otherwise the cast which is there will not release well.

## <span class="m">Cuttlefish bone</span>

 
You must not heat the <span class="m">tin</span> or <span class="m">lead</span> too hot, otherwise they will burn the <span class="m">bone</span> and become lumpy. And to know when it is the right temperature, dip in it a little piece of twisted <span class="m">paper</span>. If it turns black without catching fire, it is the right temperature. But if it burns & catches fire, it is too hot. You can cast <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span>, but it never comes out neatly. To cast something delicate well, it is necessary that the <span class="m">bone</span> not be extremely dry, because it is rough & does not release as well & crumbles & is brittle. In any case, before you cast, dry them <span class="sup">the <span class="m">bones</span></span> & especially for <span class="m">gold</span>, which does not react well to humidity. You will know that they are dry enough when, after having exposed the insides and the imprint to the fire, they hiss & crackle when you bring them near your ear. Now join the <span class="m">bone</span>s & daub the joints with a little <span class="m">lute</span> and slowly dry it near the fire & cast & then shake the mold or scratch the rough crannies and let it cool down before opening it. Usually one cuts the <span class="m">bone</span> in the middle, and the dull part that does not have half circles  is more delicate and smoother to mold with, and therefore one always uses it to do the main part of the casting, the other <span class="sup">part of the <span class="m">cuttlefish bone</span></span> is crumbly on the inside as on the outside. Therefore one does not use this to cast delicate things which need to be molded in two places. One evens out & flattens these two halves on some piece of wood, then one rubs some <span class="m">charcoal</span> on top so that it releases well. And to make sure the <span class="m">charcoal</span> is evenly spread everywhere, tap the side of the hand which is holding the half <span class="m">bone</span>. Both having been covered in <span class="m">charcoal</span>, take the first <span class="m">bone</span> that has been prepared & rounded on the edges, and having placed the medal above it, press the medal down strongly.
