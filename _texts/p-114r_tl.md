## Second Cast

 
When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is the back, the backbone, and the entire top part, and the <span class="del">len</span> half‚Äî<span class="tl">mold</span> where it is enclosed has set and is hard enough

 uncover the whole bottom part & side of the belly, <span class="del">#</span> first with a <span class="tl">knife</span> <span class="del">& tant</span> at the thickest places, & then with a <span class="tl">pen‚Äîknife</span>, where the most delicate parts are enclosed, such as the legs, the tail, & similar things, and because the head is higher, you will also need to look for it & uncover deeper, and made a deeper notch there which ought to release easily. That is to say widening by the outside, so that the second <span class="tl">mold</span> that you will cast on it can come out well, which even the animal can help with, which is malleable and obedient, having naturalness. However <span class="del">ad</span>, be more scrupulous when uncovering the throat of the <span class="al">lizard</span> rather than the <span class="al">snake</span>, for the <span class="al">lizard</span> has big jaws & big bones that are not malleable, and has hollow ears, where the wet sand has entered, is not <span class="del">aff</span> easy to release. But you will avoid all of this, if you uncover half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. Once everything is uncovered well, blow on top & wipe each part, by wiping with little <span class="tl">cloths of <span class="m"><span class="al">swine</span> fur</span></span>, slightly moistened by the end, with a little <span class="m">saliva</span>, <span class="add">or with <span class="m">clear water</span>, as you dissolve it</span>, so that <span class="del">your</span> the uncovered lower part of your animal will be very neat. <span class="add">#</span> <span class="add">üùã</span> With this done, dip <span class="del">le rev</span> <span class="del">your mold</span> your mold, for the <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">length of a pater noster</span></span> in <span class="m">water</span>, not <span class="del">du</span> <span class="add">le</span> the uncovered side but opposite, & the reverse of the uncovered thing. And this is so that, by sucking the <span class="m">water</span> <span class="add">inside</span>, the <span class="m">oil</span> with which you smear after the other side <span class="del">pour eviter</span>, is not imbibed at all, but remains on the surface & prevents the second cast that you will cast on it from attacking it. Having therefore thusly dipped <span class="add">the reverse of</span> your <span class="tl">mold</span> in the <span class="m">water</span>, take a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> especially dedicated to this, & <span class="del">en oings</span> with it smear some <span class="m">oil</span> the whole surface of the <span class="tl">mold</span>, except the animal, which must in no way touch the <span class="m">oil</span>, & take head to retrace & smear well with the point of a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> between the parts & through all the delicate parts. And if by chance the <span class="m">oil</span> is imbibed, dip the <span class="del">mo</span> reverse of the <span class="tl">mold</span> as mentioned in <span class="m">water</span>, & you will see the <span class="m">oil</span> return to the surface in little drops.

 Remove with your small <span class="tl">flat pincers</span>, all the <span class="tl">points</span>.

It is also at the level of the head that you should make the biggest notch & start with this one to uncover, and follow the rest through the trace of the <span class="tl">points</span>.
