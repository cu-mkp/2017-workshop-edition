Mortars are made of the best alloy of <span class="m">métal</span> and the finest possible <span class="m">rosette</span> so that they do not burst, that is to say one part <span class="m">métal</span> and two <span class="x">parts</span> fine <span class="m">rosette</span> or old caudron, which is even better. Some of them are of fifteen or seventeen lb. and are loaded with two and a half lb. of <span class="m">grain powder</span>, and they are put on common windows and doors.

 narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of powder they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of 4 s. lb. are eight lignes thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lignes. They have xiii poulsses long and seven in diameter at the mouth and opening.
