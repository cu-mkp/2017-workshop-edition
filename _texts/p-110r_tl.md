## Molding

 
You could mold things and animals already cast, but it never comes out as well as the one from nature, with which you can make four or five molds.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Rock</span> & <span class="env">grotto</span>

 
You need to pestle <span class="m">white & yellow marcasites</span> & various kinds of <span class="m">mines</span>, & then wash them well, so that the earthy & powdery is cleaned, & there remains only the lustrous grain of the <span class="m">mine</span>, with which you will sprinkle your <span class="m">rock</span> previously covered with <span class="m">colle forte</span>, if your <span class="del">grasse</span> <span class="env">grotto</span> is <span class="del">r</span> not for a fountain & for touching water, and you will have a nice work.
 
 
  

## Snakes

 
When they feel taken, they hardly bite, & do not have the power to harm, unless they are really big snakes. The main thing is to keep from being bitten before catching them, and having put your foot on top of it, as close to the neck as one can, one needs to grab it closest to the head, for it cannot bite if it does not have the means to stretch its neck & make a sinuous & oblique turn, & it cannot harm with a direct attack, since he cannot move forward in a direct line, but writhes in the shape of an S. I saw that the one who taught to mold them did not take this into account, & assured me that there was no trick to it, other than, when taking it, he would pull it, a little pressed & held tightly by the neck, & passing it under a shoe, he would flatten it in such a way that it would render from its bottom, which is five to six fingers from the end of its tail, all nasty and venomous things that it had in its stomach, and that after this, it does not have the strength to bite, and if by chance it should bite or expel through its bottom some filth, he would only dig the earth with a knife, & bury his hand in fresh and damp earth, which, when applied fresh on the infected part, pulls out all the venom, and nothing else. It is the same with toad’s venom, that I have seen experimented.
