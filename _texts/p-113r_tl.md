bit <span class="del">qua</span> so that <span class="del">t</span> you can take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that these <span class="tl">points</span> be of the most delicate <span class="m">iron wire</span> possible to bear the size of the animals. For, the more delicate it is, the smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs some of different thicknesses, because <span class="del">il</span> <span class="del">de</span> the <span class="tl">points</span> which are put in the body & in thicker places, like under the throat, ought to be longer & stronger than the ones of the legs & thin parts, where the <span class="tl">needles</span> ought to be subtle & delicate, almost like the biggest <span class="m">strings of <span class="mu">spinets</span></span>. And it is better that they be of <span class="m">iron wire</span>, which is firmer than <span class="m">the one of latten</span>. And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg ought to be joined to the body, do not put the <span class="tl">point</span> there, not to corrupt it. But place a piece of <span class="m">wax</span>, <span class="ms">as big as a <span class="m">grain of <span class="pa">millet</span></span></span>, between the body & <span class="del">ce</span> <span class="del">qui</span> the end of the tail, then with a bit of flattened & hot <span class="m">iron wire</span>, touch this <span class="m">wax</span> & join by lightly pressing. Thus having placed your animal on the tourtelle shaped like a <span class="mu">mandore</span>, place all around a circle of the same

 & join everything well together in a circle, then, with a big <span class="tl">knife</span>, with which you have cut your tourtelle to the right size, pare the outside which exceeds it, & place there a piece to close it as you see in b. Then, with a <span class="tl">small curved instrument</span>, mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want to give to the <span class="tl">mold</span>, which will be for a <span class="al">common snake</span> as thick as two <span class="ms"><span class="bp">poulces</span></span>, so that when you throw in your wet sand, you will see when it is thick enough. All of this scrupulously arranged, moisten well everywhere with good <span class="m">eau de vye</span> with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> the body of the animal which is uncovered. For this the secret <span class="del">de la plus</span> kept well hidden, because everything that is <span class="del">v</span> touched by <span class="m">eau de vye</span> will undoubtedly come out very neatly & without <span class="del">bubbles</span> any small eyes or holes that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back & in the thick sides of the <span class="tl">mold</span>, but on the edges. And as soon as you have thusly moistened everything with <span class="m">eau de vye</span>, throw in your wet sand without letting the <span class="m">eau de vye</span> dry, which evaporates promptly. And wet it thusly.

 and make sure that the <span class="tl">point</span> is long according to the height you want the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed thusly, plant your <span class="al">snake</span> on the slab of <span class="m">earth</span>, & arrange the head first and then the rest.

>   If, when you pierce your animal, it renders <span class="m">water</span> from the bottom of the side of the belly, on the slab of <span class="m">earth</span>, clean it well with <span class="m">cotton</span> for the sand that would touch it would be lumpy. If it is on top of the animal, clean it very scrupulously and touch it &moisten well with <span class="m">eau de vye</span>. 
 
 
  

## Wetting sand and molding the first cast

 
Take a <span class="tl">bowl of <span class="m">leaded</span> <span class="m">earth</span></span> of such size that it can hold the wet sand, which will be needed <span class="del">de</span> to fill your <span class="tl">mold</span> in one go, which is <span class="del">mei</span> better than in two gos, because if you do not throw the second wet batch very promptly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the first one will set & become solid,
