## <span class="m">Varnish</span> for lutes

 
They take a little <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m">oil of turpentine or of <span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span> & <span class="m">amber pulverized</span> & passed very subtly & make as that of <span class="m">mastic</span>, & add in to color it a little <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span> and make it reddish, and others some <span class="m">terra merita</span> for yellow.
 
 
  

## Borders for a Garden

 
You have to work the ground, then then it with a rake, and afterwards if it is dry you must <span class="m">wet</span> it. Then stretch a cord clean on the ground, and along its length hit the cord with the back of a pruning knife, so that the cord marks a right line. Along its length you will make holes with an <span class="m">iron</span> stake, where you will plant rosemary, its head lopped off & cut to measure and thinned out at the foot.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Locksmith</span>

 
To well <span class="m">tin</span> nails and other work, they <span class="tl">file</span> their work very neatly. Then to clean it well & rid it of fattiness, they make it boil in <span class="m">vinegar</span>, then they wipe it well with a <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">linen</span></span></span>. Next they heat it & pass some <span class="m">resin</span> over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like <span class="m">varnish</span>. This done, they melt some <span class="m">pure & fine tin</span> in their <span class="m">estamiere</span>, which is a little square <span class="m">iron</span> box. And when the <span class="m">tin</span> is well melted & moderately warm, they throw in <span class="m">resin</span> in to burn the filth, & then they let the <span class="tl">head of a nail</span> or something similar soak a little, & having remained there for seven or eight <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">pauses</span></span>, they take it out and shake it, hitting the top with an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span></span> to make the <span class="m">tin</span> that is superfluous fall off, & clean it with a <span class="tl">small stick wrapped in <span class="m">tow</span></span>. And if it is not well <span class="m">tinned</span>, you will hit it hot with a piece of <span class="m">resin</span> & do as before & let it cool. When the work cools, it becomes yellow, which is a sign that the <span class="m">tin</span> is the right temperature. But it becomes blue if the <span class="m">tin</span> is too hot. Things <span class="del">t</span> thus <span class="m">tinned</span> are durable & are not undone like <span class="m">tinning done in leaf</span>, thus at the end of a <span class="tmp">year</span> they can be clarified & renewed by heating & rubbing them.
 
<span class="pro">Leadsmiths</span> say that making a <span class="al">lizard</span> die in the melted <span class="del">il des</span> <span class="m">tin</span> makes the <span class="m">tinning</span> become very golden. Or else putting in <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>.
