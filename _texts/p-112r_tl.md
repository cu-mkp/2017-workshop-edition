## To soak <span class="m">sand</span>

 
You need to have a big basin full of <span class="m">water</span> to soak the molds to open them, a tankard full of <span class="m">common water</span>, a lead bowl for soaking your sand, a small <span class="m">wooden</span> spoon to collect the soaked <span class="m">sand</span> in the bowl.

## Decoction of <span class="m">sands</span>

## Molding en noyau. Mixture of <span class="m">sand</span>

 
Having reheated your <span class="m">sand</span>, namely the <span class="m">plaster</span>, the <span class="m">alum de plume</span> & the <span class="m">brick</span>, & having passed them finely through the sieve, # mix them this way, take four parts of <span class="m">plaster</span>, two of <span class="m">brick</span>, & one of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>. Mix them all together with your hands, in such a way that one cannot discern one from the other. With your <span class="m">sand</span> ready, you need to kill the animal that you want to mold in this way.

## Killing the animal to be molded

 
It is necessary that you be scrupulous to not wound it at all in taking it. And having put it in a glass bottle with some bran, or in a barrel half full of fresh & damp earth, if you want to stock them or keep them a long time, give them live frogs and not dead ones to eat, for if you keep them without feeding them, they wither & grow thin, & have long wrinkled skins. Thus the best would be to mold it as soon as possible after it has been taken. But before, kill it in this way. Place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that it collects no <span class="m">dust</span>. And put inside a sufficient quantity of good vinegar and urine so that it can be covered. And shake and torment it inside, until it is dead, which will be in on or a half hour. But if you are in a hurry

>   To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the <span class="m">vinegar</span> and take it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling, & when piercing it, it would retract & spoil the mold.
