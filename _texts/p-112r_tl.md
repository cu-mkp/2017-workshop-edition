## To soak sand

 
You need to have a big <span class="tl">basin</span> full of <span class="m">water</span> to <span class="del">q</span> soak the <span class="tl">molds</span> to open them, a <span class="tl">tankard</span> full of <span class="m"><span class="add">common</span> water</span>, a <span class="tl"><span class="m">lead</span> bowl</span> for soaking your sand, a small <span class="tl"><span class="m">wooden</span> spoon</span> to collect the soaked sand in the <span class="tl">bowl</span>. <span class="del">The big <span class="tl">basin</span> is</span> <span class="del">pour tr</span>

## Decoction of sands

 
Already mentionned.
 
 
  

## Molding en noyau. Mixture of sand

 
Having reheated your sand, namely the <span class="m">plaster</span>, the <span class="m">alum de plume</span> & the <span class="m">brick</span>, & having passed them finely <span class="add">through the <span class="tl">sieve</span> #</span>, mix them this way, take four <span class="ms">parts</span> of <span class="m">plaster</span>, two of <span class="m">brick</span>, & one of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>. Mix them all together with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span>, <span class="del">qu’il</span> in such a way that one cannot discern one from the other. With your sand ready, you need to kill the animal that you want to mold <span class="del">de</span> in this way.

## Killing the animal to be molded

 
It is necessary that you be scrupulous to not wound it at all in taking it. And having put it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> bottle</span> <span class="del">d</span> with some <span class="m">bran</span>, or in a <span class="tl">barrel</span> <span class="del">full</span> half full of <span class="m">fresh & damp earth</span>, if you want to stock them or keep them a <span class="tmp">long time</span>, give them live <span class="al">frogs</span> & not dead ones to eat, for if you keep them without feeding them, they wither & grow thin, & have long wrinkled skins. Thus the best would be to mold it as soon as <span class="del">apres</span> possible <span class="del">apre</span> after it has been taken. But before, kill it in this way. Place it in a <span class="tl">clean bottle or vessel</span> so that it collects no dust. And put inside a sufficient quantity of <span class="m">good vinegar</span> & <span class="m">urine</span> so that it can be covered. And shake & torment it inside, until it is dead, which will be in on or a <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">half hour</span></span>. But if you are in a hurry

>   To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the <span class="m">vinegar</span> and take it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling, & when piercing it, it would retract & spoil the mold.
