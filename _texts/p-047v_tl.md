## A beverage which tastes like wine

 
Take <span class="m">tartar</span> from large vessels, dilute it in <span class="m">water</span>, and it will taste like wine.
 
 
  

## Melting

 
Some, to make it run neatly, put <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">metal</span> & <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">copper</span>. Others take one <span class="ms">part</span> of <span class="m">potin</span> & one <span class="ms">part</span> of <span class="del"><span class="m">copper</span></span> <span class="m">latten</span>. Others take one <span class="ms">part</span> of <span class="m">candlesticks latten</span> & one <span class="ms">part</span> of <span class="m">basin latten</span>. And among basins, the <span class="m">latten</span> of larger ones is more brittle than that of skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones, that have a more ample round shape, the substance can be more brittle. In any event, the most brittle <span class="m">latten</span> runs better, & casts more neatly, but it must be cast very <span class="del">neat</span> hot. <span class="del">One</span> When one wants to cast, one casts <span class="m">lead</span> into the substance, which makes it flow & run & goes up in smoke, & keeps the <span class="tl">mold</span> from corrupting. And if you want to cast pieces de foeu, mix in more <span class="m">rosette</span> than <span class="m">latten</span>, so that it is less breakable. The <span class="tl">crucibles for melting <span class="m">metal</span></span> should be better than <span class="tl">those for <span class="pro">glassmakers</span></span> for <span class="m">glass</span> is not as heavy as <span class="m">metal</span>. And in this instance, one needs to lute the <span class="tl">crucibles</span> with <span class="m">earth</span> and <span class="m">crushed glass</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Crucibles</span>

 
Those made <span class="tmp">in winter</span> & <span class="env"><span class="tmp">humid weather</span></span> are not good. Those of the founders should be thick and should be luted.
 
 
  

## Cast

 
Finely <span class="m">calcinated pumice stone</span> casts 22 <span class="ms">carat</span> <span class="m">gold</span> without repair, but it needs to be ablaze and red like the <span class="m">metal</span>. And it withstands several casts.
