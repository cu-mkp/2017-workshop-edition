<span class="m">flour</span>. And to flatten it, take a small stick of <span class="m">wood</span> that is round and of an even thickness, which has at both ends a small circle that sticks out from the rest, in order to give the necessary thickness to your <span class="m">paste</span>. And then with this rolling pin, flatten it so that it becomes thin and tenuous. Then apply it on the hollow part of your mold and press it down with <span class="m">cotton</span>, and your figure will impress itself on the paste, in relief on one side, and hollow on the other. This done, with a brush that is dipped in melted <span class="m">butter</span>, grease the part of the <span class="m">paste</span> that is hollow. Then trim off the extra <span class="m">paste</span> which extends beyond the hollow of the mold. Also <span class="m">oil</span> your mold with <span class="m">olive oil</span>, as you have done with others. Apply your <span class="m">clay</span> contour, and cast your second mold. And you will have a medal as thin and hollow on one side as you wish. You can have various rolling pins which some edges are more raised than others, in order to make various thicknesses, or you can use sheets <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">copper</span> of various thicknesses, or <span class="m">cardboard</span>, all cut with the rolling pin.

> If you were to <span class="m">oil</span> your <span class="m">paste</span>, the <span class="m">paste</span> would absorb the <span class="m">oil</span> and it <span class="sup">the oil</span> would penetrate through the <span class="m">paste</span>, right up to the edge of the mold and attack it. But <span class="m">butter</span> remains on the surface of the <span class="m">paste</span>, and does not penetrate it. For these back bits, you must not temper your sand with <span class="m">hot water</span>, because it will melt the <span class="m">butter</span>.

## Testing the virtues and strength of sand that is to be reheated

 
Once the sand has taken hold, you must find it soft and easy to cut, and not surly. It is better to test it in a large and fantastical mold, rather than a small one, because the big one will stay in the fire longer and the small one reheats very quickly.

 
  

## Softening <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Sometimes, you can find <span class="m">gold</span> that is so dry that neither <span class="m">cement</span> nor <span class="m">antimony</span> can soften it. Only <span class="m">verdigris</span> can soften this <span class="m">gold</span>.
