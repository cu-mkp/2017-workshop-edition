and immediately you will be able to crumble it between your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> and to easily grind it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">metal</span> mortar</span>, or better yet, in an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> one</span>. Next, it will be easy to grind it, not <span class="del">only</span> on <span class="m">common <span class="tl">marble</span></span> <span class="add">that would corrode</span>, but on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, and it is necessary that it be finely ground with <span class="add"><span class="m">water</span></span> so that when putting it on your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingernail</span></span>, you find it soft without any asperity like the colors that the <span class="pro">painters</span> grind for <span class="m">oil</span>. You can use <span class="del">au lii</span> this one, once dry, in a box mold instead of sand, without moistening it with anything nor reheating it. If you do not like it, fumigate the cavity with <span class="m">sulfur</span> smoke or <span class="del">de p</span> with the tip of the flame of a <span class="tl"><span class="m">wax candle</span></span> that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat & shiny & polished work, in <span class="m"><span class="add">pure</span> lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>. I would say the same for <span class="m">finely pulverized tripoly</span> that does not want to be <span class="del">not</span> reheated or moistened. <span class="m">Burnt linen</span> gives less trouble than others, because it does not need to be reheated, nor moistened, & molds <span class="add">and releases</span> very neatly <span class="del">& very</span>, subtlety <span class="del">& releases well</span> neat, like the previous ones & withstands several castings. First you ought to burn it with a flame, then leave it to rest & to be consumed with its fire until it is completely dead, then finely grind it on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> or on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span>. <span class="del">But because a lot</span> And if you reheat it in a <span class="tl">crucible</span>, red hot due to the fire, to render all of it fine & impalpable, I believe it will be even better. But because a lot of <span class="m">linen</span> is reduced to very little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the medal that you want to mold & cover it, and fill the <span class="tl">box mold</span> with <span class="m">crushed slate</span>, which molds also very neatly, but note that the first cast is always the most beautiful & the neatest. If you cast at your convenience <span class="m">soft tin</span> that seems to be burnished in little wheels that <span class="pro">pewterers</span> sell, comes out very neatly & approaching the color of <span class="m">silver</span>, without mixing in anything else, it is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, & so that the molded object should be four <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> away from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, <span class="add">so hot</span> <span class="del">with such a <span class="ms">degree of heat</span></span> that it promptly burns a <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> or <span class="tl"><span class="m">straw</span></span> placed inside, by simmering. Then remove it from the fire & leave it to rest a little & cast the <span class="m">tin</span> mixed
