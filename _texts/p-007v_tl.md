## For giving the color of all kinds of <span class="m">metals</span> to <span class="m">wood</span> & other things

 
Take <span class="m">touchstone</span> & <span class="m">pumice stone</span> as much of one as of the other & grind them together & mix with a <span class="m">glue de retailles</span> stronger than that used for painting, & paint it on whatever you like. Once dry, rub this layer with any <span class="m">metal</span> whatsoever, then burnish it.
 
 
  

## Against windy colic

 
Take a dozen dried <span class="m">common <span class="pa">walnuts</span></span> and throw them one after another onto a good <span class="tl">brazier</span> where they may catch fire, and take them out with <span class="tl">tongs</span>, and let them burn and flame well in the air, and extinguish them in a glass of good <span class="m">wine</span>. Then let the <span class="m">wine</span> cool and filter it, then pour half of it, since six extinguished <span class="m">nuts</span> make one dose. An excellent cure against suffocation of the matrix.
 
 
  

## To relieve the pain of g<span class="exp">out</span>

 
Take half a pound of finely powdered golden and yellow <span class="m">marcasite</span>, half an ounce of <span class="m">storax</span>, 4 lb. of <span class="m">urine</span>, incorporate well together, little by little, in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>, then boil all together quite strongly. But the pot needs to be well covered so the smoke does not escape. Then distill the imbibed <span class="m">urine</span>, separated by inclination, in an <span class="tl">alembic</span>, well luted and covered with a <span class="m">copper</span> head. And soak a cloth with the said <span class="m">water</span> and apply it lukewarm on the pain.
 
 
  

## Against gonorrhea

 
Cook .i. lb. of <span class="m">old smiths' water</span>, .i. ℥ of <span class="m"><span class="pl">Armenian</span> bole</span> reduced in the finest powder, and .iii. ʒ of <span class="m">common honey</span>, until the <span class="m">honey</span> stops foaming. Once cooled, strain with great pressure and use the results of filtration by injection.
