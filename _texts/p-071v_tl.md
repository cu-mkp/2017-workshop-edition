## <span class="m">Varnish</span>

 
To a <span class="ms">half lb</span> of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>, put in 4 <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">sandarac</span> & <span class="m">mastic, pulverized subtly</span> . And first, boil your <span class="m">oil</span> in a <span class="tl">pot</span> on a <span class="tl">chafing dish</span>, and then mix in little <span class="add">by little</span> the aforesaid <span class="m">gums</span>, stirring continually with a <span class="tl">small stick split and quartered at the tip</span>, & when you do not collect <span class="m">gum</span> with the tip, that is to say that it is totally melted & that your <span class="m">varnish</span> is done. And to render it clearer, put into the concoction a little lump of <span class="m">camphor</span>. It is true that with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> will be good, clear & not fatty, otherwise your <span class="m">varnish</span> will be worth nothing. You can test it <span class="del">d</span> by soaking some <span class="m">paper</span> in it & heating it. If the <span class="m">oil</span>, which will evaporate, leaves the <span class="m">paper</span> clean, without <span class="del">being</span> a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is fatty.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Sheep</span> fat</span>

 
In a certain part of <span class="pl">England</span>, the <span class="al">sheep</span> that graze there have very yellow <span class="m">fat</span> and are nevertheless just as good as others.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Spider</span>

 
There are no <span class="sup">spiders</span> in <span class="pl">Ireland</span>, & if one touches them with some <span class="m">wood</span> that they have there, they die. That is why some rich people from <span class="pl">England</span> make their floors with this <span class="m">wood</span>, & in this way, they do not have any spiderwebs.
 
 
  

## Sand

 
The <span class="m">cimolée</span> is very good for casting in <span class="m">copper</span>, but one ought not take <span class="m">the one from <span class="pro">cutlers</span></span>, because it is only <span class="m">sludge</span>, but rather the one of those who <span class="del">moulent</span> mold large shears.
 
<span class="m">Pierres de filieres</span>, which <span class="pro">knife grinders</span> use for whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for <span class="m">lead</span>. It is commonly <span class="m">slate</span>—colored. One frequently brings them to <span class="pl">Toulouse</span> from around <span class="pl">Carcassonne</span> .
