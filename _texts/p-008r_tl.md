## <span class="m">Gold</span> lettering on <span class="m">paper</span>

 
Write with <span class="m">milk of the <span class="pa">fig tree</span></span> then let it dry a little, next lay the <span class="m">gold</span>leaf, & once quite dry, rub with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span> cloth</span> and only the lettering will remain.
 
 
  

## To explode grenades and give force to fireworks

 
Put into the <span class="m">powder</span> one sixth as much of <span class="m">quicksilver</span>
 
 
  

## Tempering bullets to pierce bulletâ€”proof armor

 
Heat the <span class="m">lead</span> bullet as much as you can without melting it, and once it is hot dip it into the strongest <span class="m">vinegar</span> that you can. And do this four or five times. Afterwards, mince some <span class="m">lard</span> very finely and some <span class="m">linen</span> also very delicately, mix all this together and use it as wadding, making it go into the arquebus or pistol with a little strength and very tightly. And before shooting, if possible, the bullet should be hot.
 
 
  

## To make a breach in a wall by night

 
Having made a hole in a wall as you know, put one mortar inside, charged with <span class="m">powder</span>, almost flat, and another upright, then fill in the hole and fire.
