the <span class="tl">crucible</span> is red. Next, throw it on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, and you will have a substance white, hard & even, like <span class="m">alabaster</span>, with which you will be able to cast medals which will resemble <span class="m">marble</span>, but keep them out of the humidity.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Jacinth</span>

 
Is made like <span class="m">ruby</span>, with <span class="m">gold</span>; but one does not need such a great fire. The <span class="m">ruby</span> wants fire for a whole <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">day</span></span>, and if it does not have enough fire, it will only have red veins.

## <span class="m">Topaz</span>

 
I melted one part of calcinated & pulverized <span class="m">pumice stone</span> <span class="del">& tr</span> with three parts of <span class="m">minium</span>, the stone having been pulverized in a steel mortar. A very beautiful yellow came to me, without any grain more yellow than the others. It is true that it was strongly charged with colour. I believe it would be better to pulverize the <span class="m">pumice</span> in a glass mortar, because it & the <span class="m">minium</span> make enough yellow by themselves. A mass came to me, the top of which was the beautiful yellow, as mentioned, and the bottom was like a <span class="m">fire—stone</span> without transparency. With which, in mixing other
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span>

 
The <span class="pl">Germans</span> make <span class="m">minium</span> boil a lot in <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span>, & to give it the body of <span class="m">varnish</span>, they mix in <span class="m">very pulverized yellow amber</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gum ammoniac</span>

 
One puts it by small pieces into a little good <span class="m">vinegar</span>, & one heats, then one passes it through a <span class="tl">cloth strainer</span>. All <span class="m">medicinal gums</span> dissolve in <span class="m">vinegar</span>.
