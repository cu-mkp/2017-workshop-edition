## <span class="m">Lead</span> casting

 
Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of <span class="env">churches</span>, <span class="del">y</span> melt <span class="del">one</span> for one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">tin</span> half a <span class="ms">pound</span> of <span class="m">lead</span>, & cast in <span class="m">stone</span>, & if they want their work whiter, they put <span class="del">p</span> <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">tin</span> and <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">lead</span>, but the first mixture is the best, & does not become porous. One needs to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke their <span class="tl">molds</span> with a <span class="m">resin candle</span> to cast neatly. The <span class="m">antimony</span> makes the substance brittle & breakable. The <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> makes the work whiter, but not more runny, as for <span class="m">tin</span>, it is good <span class="del">to the</span> with <span class="m">pure lead</span>. Those who make very neat <span class="m">lead</span> casts, use <span class="tl">bodkins</span>. <span class="pro">Pewterers</span> cast in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> mold</span>. One says that one makes the <span class="m">lead</span> stick on the <span class="m">glass</span> with <span class="m">resin</span>. Others put into the <span class="m">lead</span> a <span class="ms">quarter</span> of <span class="m">tin</span>. <span class="m">Looking glass tin </span> renders the work stronger.

## Sand for <span class="m">lead</span> casting

 
<span class="m"><span class="pa">Rye</span> straw ashes</span> well boiled then dried & then well <span class="tl">sieved</span>. Alloy it with <span class="m">egg white</span>. One can cast there <span class="m">copper</span>, <span class="m">latten</span> and other things.
 
 
  

## Other

 
<span class="m">Burnt & calcined pumice stone</span>, <span class="m">burnt & calcined <span class="al">cuttlefish</span> bones</span>, in the same quantity; & <span class="m">ashes of <span class="pa">walnut tree</span></span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">vine</span></span>, boiled, dried & finely <span class="tl">sieved</span> alloy with <span class="m">egg white</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Pewterers</span>

 
They put into one <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">fine tin</span> one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">looking glass tin</span>, which renders the <span class="m">tin</span> thicker. There are two kinds of <span class="m">tin</span>, one of them, nearly like <span class="m">lead</span>, which runs better, the other, brittle, which renders itself thicker. They cast in solid <span class="tl"><span class="m">tin</span> molds</span> & thick or, to do it more neatly in <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> molds engraved with a <span class="tl">burin</span>, or in <span class="m">stone</span> or in <span class="m">earth</span></span>. <span class="m">Latten</span> shards, mixed in, only rendering the <span class="m">tin</span> more breakable & harder & difficult to work with, they cast <span class="add">in</span> very hot <span class="tl">molds</span> <span class="del">& almost red</span> & very hot <span class="m">tin</span>. They fumigate their <span class="tl"><span class="m">tin</span> molds</span> with <span class="m">resin candles</span>.
 
<span class="m">Brittle <span class="del">dou</span> tin</span> is found mixed into saulmons, easy for cutting, but difficult to put to work &melts if it is not mixed with the other soft one. Otherwise, it would become waste.
