## <span class="m">Sapphire</span>

 
One finds <span class="m">sapphires</span> that one calls de treille, because they are pierced and it is said that a certain <span class="pro">king</span> had made from these a certain ornament in the shape of a trellis, that would be thus named the Screen of <span class="pn">Charlemagne</span> in the treasure of <span class="pl">Saint Denis</span>, in which the <span class="m">gemstones</span> are set without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one side & the other, &to show their naivete. I have a white one that seems to be rough & pierced, and is spotted all over with blue blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial & that they are of <span class="m">taffre</span> or <span class="m">very clear esmail azuré</span> melted entirely on the <span class="m">sapphire</span>. <span class="add">The <span class="tl">file</span> bites it as on the <span class="m">beryl</span>.</span>
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pa">Saffron</span></span>

 
It is counterfeited & augmented with <span class="m"><span class="pa">marigold</span> leaves</span> half—dried, & twisted like a <span class="m">thread</span>, & put <span class="env">in the hottest sun</span> to dry, & is mixed, & the aforesaid <span class="pa">marigold</span> even gives some color.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sapphire</span>

 
<span class="pro">Stone cutters</span> sometimes choose old pieces of <span class="m">antique glass</span> in <span class="env">church</span> windows, which are much thicker than those of <span class="tmp">today</span> & are of more lively colors. If it is for <span class="del">souf</span> <span class="m">sapphire</span>, they choose beautiful blue & from such a place that there are no <span class="del">pieces</span> <span class="add">grains</span>, if it is possible. And having cut it in squares with <span class="m">emery</span>, they cut it in bevel & polish it. And in this manner, they counterfeit very beautiful <span class="m">sapphires</span>. The old <span class="m">esmail d’azur</span> for <span class="m">silver</span> verging on aquamarine was very appropriate for counterfeiting <span class="m">sapphires</span>, but it is scarcely found. One counterfeits <span class="m">aquamarines</span> with <span class="m">white glass</span>, but they take it from the bottom of the <span class="m">glass</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Amber</span>

 
The orangeish color that is in <span class="m">transparent amber</span> and in the other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is whitish. But through age <span class="del">it</span> or wearing it, it acquires this reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the <span class="tl">file</span> or on the <span class="tl">wheel</span> do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But they only polish it, rubbing it with a <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="pa">willow</span></span> stick</span> or other <span class="m">soft wood</span> dipped into <span class="m">water</span> & dusted with <span class="m">tripoli of <span class="pl">Brittany</span></span> , and it takes a beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow & you want to intensify its color, hang it inside a <span class="env">chimney</span> where there is much <span class="m">soot</span> & <span class="m">smoke</span>, and it will take on a reddish—orange color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under <span class="m">dung</span> to turn it green, like <span class="m">bones</span>. Or <span class="m">smoke</span> it <span class="env">in a closed space</span>, in the <span class="m">smoke of safre</span> or <span class="m">manganese</span> & other <span class="m">drugs</span> that you know. Or in <span class="m">urine</span> & <span class="m">distilled vinegar</span> mixed with colors, or in the <span class="m">vapor of aqua fortis</span> boiling in <span class="m">copper</span>, or <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> boiling with <span class="m">silver</span> & <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> & Some cut <span class="m">amber</span> in facets on a <span class="tl">wheel of <span class="m">soft wood</span></span> with <span class="m">potée</span> instead of <span class="m">emery</span>, & <span class="m">jet</span> also. The <span class="m">salt called de Langlois de armonic</span> is a <span class="m">mineral salt</span> that resembles <span class="m">marble stone</span> and is a very hard mineral with large pieces, like that of <span class="pl">Cardona</span> & <span class="pl">Monserrat</span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   I have experimented by making it boil in <span class="m">lye</span> or <span class="m">corrosive water</span>, it turns reddish on the surface. And if it is rubbed against <span class="m"><span class="pa">fir</span></span> & <span class="m">soft wood</span> before it is cooled, it is easily cut.
