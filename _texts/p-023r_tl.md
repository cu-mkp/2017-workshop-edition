A mortar is made so that it weighs three <span class="ms">quintals</span> and carries a cannonball flat on the side from which it must exit and round on the side of the cannon, as if it was a cannonball cut in half. It is two pans long. It has to be loaded with xxv <span class="ms">lb</span> of powder because it has to be full to the opening and has to fire. Its bottom is not thicker than the opening and is made of one single piece. Its material has to be better than other artillery pieces, and for 4 <span class="ms">quintals</span> of fine <span class="m">copper</span> there must only be one quintal of <span class="m">metal</span> so that it absorbs the shock, and so that, when fired with more force, it is more efficient. It has to be used against a door with a large <span class="m">iron</span> cross before the bullet, and once loaded, needs to be covered with a firmly sewed rough <span class="m">canvas</span> which should be completely smeared with <span class="m">turpentine</span>. Four handles need to be added to it while it is cast, it is thus easier to place. The <span class="m">iron</span> cross is fixed to the opening with the <span class="m">canvas</span> covering it. The handles have to be held at its opening's edge, as you can see. To place it, you need three or four <span class="m">iron</span> <span class="tl">pegs</span> of one <span class="ms">pan</span> long and as thick as a <span class="ms"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>, which have their point like a <span class="tl">gimlet</span>, and their body like a screw as they are strongly pulled, and a ring on the other side to turn them with a short <span class="tl">stick</span> that fits into the <span class="tl">ring</span>. And the <span class="tl">pegs</span> are fixed on the door, not straight, because they would not have any strength, but crooked as if you wanted to fix them towards the middle of the <span class="m">mortar</span>, and to do the holes of the handles need to be quite large. In that way, the shooting <span class="m">mortar</span> pushes the <span class="tl">pegs</span> back and forth into the door, and makes more damage. Once in place, you need to have saucisse de <span class="m">buckram</span> @ made in this manner: take eight or nine <span class="ms">canes</span> of <span class="m">buckram</span> selvage or more if the gap is larger, which have to be as large as four or five <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span>, have it sewn in such a way so that it is like an intestine where a <span class="tl">stick</span> as thick as a <span class="ms"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> can fit. Fill it completely with good

>   This one is to be put below an undermined tower with its opening towards the top. One casts two large <span class="m">iron</span> <span class="tl">rings</span> and, with a <span class="tl">stick</span> or two, four men carry it. They are also used for placing within wall breaches but just half a charge is necessary, that is x <span class="ms">lb</span>, and fill the rest with some <span class="m">pebbles</span> and <span class="m">cart stones</span>

>   It needs to be covered entirely with a <span class="m">waxed</span> <span class="m">canvas</span> and rubbed with <span class="m">turpentine</span> and other <span class="m">combustible things</span>. This cover is made to ensure that the bullet does not fall and so that, when the cover is given fire, the <span class="m">powder</span> does not fail. Upon the fuse, you will need to put a good quantity of <span class="m">powder</span>. Some put on the ball a cross of <span class="m">iron</span> which is longer than the mouth of the <span class="m">mortar</span> by two <span class="ms">pans</span>. Others only put the ball.
