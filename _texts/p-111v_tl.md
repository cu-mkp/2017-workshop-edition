## <span class="m">Essence of sal ammoniac</span>

 
The <span class="ms">size of two <span class="m"><span class="pa">chestnuts</span></span></span> of <span class="m">pulverized sal ammoniac</span> suffices in a <span class="ms"><span class="tl">pot</span></span> of <span class="m">water</span>, and <span class="sn">to the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">tongue</span></span> you find the <span class="m">water</span> moderatly <span class="m">salty</span></span>, for too much is not good.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sanguine</span>

 
To clean the various colors of <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>, one pulverizes <span class="m">sanguine</span> & with some <span class="tl">cloths</span>, one rubs the <span class="del">e</span> molded <span class="add">work</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Crab</span> and <span class="al">crayfish</span>

 
 These are the hardest to mold & whoever molds them well will mold many other very delicate things.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Lizards</span>

 
When one takes them with two <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> from the sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their <span class="del">g</span> mouth, then one takes the <span class="del">a</span> end of its lower mandibule, <span class="add">with the end of the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingernail</span></span></span>, & after with the one from above it bites the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">nail</span></span>, but it cannot pass through, but it bites very well. And if it were to bite living <span class="bp">flesh</span> it would <span class="del">au</span> not let go, & there would be no better remedy than to promptly cut off his head. <span class="tmp">In the spring</span>, as they have changed skin, they are more beautiful.

>   The small <span class="al">lizards</span> that one takes in the <span class="tmp">summer</span>, the size of small <span class="al">female lizards</span>, grey on the back & green on the belly, are very appropriate to cast in <span class="m">silver</span>, & <span class="m">gold</span>, or other <span class="m">metal</span>, because their have rougher scales than the of <span class="al">female lizards</span> & show better.

## Composition of sand

 
Everything once reheated as it said here above, take four 4 full <span class="ms"><span class="tl">crucibles</span></span> of <span class="m">plaster</span>, two 2 of <span class="m">brick</span>, & one of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>. Do not pass through the <span class="tl">sieve</span> to mix, <span class="del">may</span> because the <span class="m">alum</span> would not pass. Mix with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span>, until neither one nor the other, neither white nor red, is recognised among the other. If your <span class="m">plaster</span> was not strong, do not mix at all so much <span class="m">alum de plume</span>, because it softens the <span class="tl">molds</span>. Take head also that your sand is not hot (since it has immediately been reheated) <span class="del">C</span> when you will want to mix it with <span class="m">water</span>, for this <span class="del">les</span> makes <span class="tl">molds</span> too soft & breakable. 
 
> *at left bottom margin*

>   You may sometimes diminish the quantity of <span class="m">plaster</span> if you do not find it strong enough to withstands fire & if it cracks <span class="del">&</span> so that the part of <span class="m">crushed tiles</span> holds up, with the <span class="m">alum de plume</span>, which you can also increase so that it creates a better bond.
