## <span class="m">Essence of sal ammoniac</span>

 
The size of two <span class="m">chestnuts</span> of pulverized <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> suffices in a pot of <span class="m">water</span>, and to the tongue you find the water moderatly salty, for too much is not good. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sanguine</span>

 
To clean the various colors of <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span>, one pulverizes <span class="m">sanguine</span> & with some cloths, one rubs the molded work.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Crab</span> and <span class="al">crayfish</span>

 
 These are the hardest to mold & whoever molds them well will mold many other very delicate things.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Lizards</span>

 
When one takes them with two fingers from the sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their mouth, then one takes the end of its lower mandibule, with the end of the fingernail, & after with the one from above it bites the nail, but it cannot pass through, but it bites very well. And if it were to bite living flesh it would not let go, & there would be no better remedy than to promptly cut off his head. In the spring, as they have changed skin, they are more beautiful.

## Composition of <span class="m">sand</span>

 
Everything once reheated as it said here above, take four 4 full crucibles of <span class="m">plaster</span>, two 2 of <span class="m">brick</span>, & one of <span class="m">alum de plume</span>. Do not pass through the sieve to mix, because the <span class="m">alum</span> would not pass. Mix with your hands, until neither one nor the other, neither white nor red, is recognised among the other. If your <span class="m">plaster</span> was not strong, do not mix at all so much <span class="m">alum de plume</span>, because it softens the molds. Take head also that your <span class="m">sand</span> is not hot (since it has immediately been reheated) when you will want to mix it with <span class="m">water</span>, for this makes molds too soft & breakable.

>   You may sometimes diminish the quantity of <span class="m">plaster</span> if you do not find it strong enough to withstands, with the <span class="m">alum de plume</span>, which you can also increase so that it creates a better bond.
