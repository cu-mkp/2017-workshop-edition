## <span class="m">Damasked Cloth</span>

 
You can damask a <span class="m"> cloth</span> of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is <span class="m">dye</span>d yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <span class="m">string</span> or a bigger <span class="m">cord</span> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a <span class="m">dye</span> of <span class="m">woad</span> or <span class="m">pastel</span> and it will become green, except that which is beneath the <span class="m">string</span>, which will remain yellow because the <span class="m">green dye</span> will not have penetrated there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <span class="m">string</span> or <span class="m">cord</span>, add some pieces of poor quality <span class="m">cloth</span> cut in Moorish shapes on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.
 
 
  

## Casting molten <span class="m">metals</span>

 
One casts candlesticks and small works in a <span class="tl">frame</span> with sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles the frame with <span class="m">flour</span> in order to make the <span class="del">e metal</span> <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">latten</span> run better. When the sand has been used for a <span class="ms">month</span>, it is necessary to take some new sand, because the one that was used, having been reheated <span class="del">in fire</span> \+, dries out & loses its ability to bond. However, it is used to mix with the new sand, for it makes the work not so porous. One casts large works such as artillery, bells & similar things in <span class="m">earth</span>, & <span class="m">copper</span> cast in <span class="m">earth</span> makes less of a chappe, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The <span class="m">earth</span> is <span class="m">sandy clay</span> mixed with <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span> dung</span> & <span class="m">cloth</span> waste. The <span class="m">earth</span> that <span class="del">is</span> has been used for casting, which is black, baked & as if burnt, is used to cast, <span class="del">gecte</span> mixed with <span class="m">artificial sand</span>, & is very good. <span class="add">To soften & make the <span class="m">copper</span> run, throw in, once it is melted, a little <span class="m">lead</span>, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of the cast.</span>

## Casting <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>

 
The sand must be from something very dry & arid & reheated well in the <span class="tl">frame</span>, because, if it were humid, like <span class="m"><span class="pro">founder</span>'s sand</span>, the <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> would spatter, & cause damage. It is also necessary for the <span class="m">earth</span> to absorb the <span class="m">metal</span>, for cast <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span> <span class="del">is</span> become very spongy. That is why it must be beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon handles.
