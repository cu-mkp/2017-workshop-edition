*[continued]*
  
when they want to bite or eat something, they do not bite with a direct attack, but with sinuous turns & from the side, as do <span class="pn">Satan</span> & his <span class="pro">disciples</span>. It has a small head, but a very long body. The entryway to sin seems small & inconsequential, but the consequences of it are very great. It abstains from eating seven or eight <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>, once it has devoured some <span class="al">frog</span>. It can swallow three or four of them, one after the other, and what he devoured is neither corrupted nor consumed in one go in its stomach, but <span class="del">p</span> any part little by little, that is to say bones and everything. And the remains are found as fresh as when it had devoured them, such that sometimes, when one presses & torments it, it renders what it has engulfed, parts of which are found totally consumed & others as fresh as if it were alive. It can keep for two to three <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span> a <span class="al">frog</span> engulfed & renders it completely alive.
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Toad</span>

 
If by chance you want to mold this vile animal & if it <span class="m">pisses</span> in your <span class="bp">hand</span>, it would burn your <span class="bp">hand</span> & itch, as if you had handled <span class="pa">nettles</span>. But the most powerful <span class="md">remedy</span> for this is to put your <span class="bp">hand</span> <span class="env">into fresh <span class="m">earth</span></span>, & to cover it as if you wanted to bury it. A <span class="al">frog</span> is not so beautiful molded because it has lively skin, & the other has a lumpy one.

>   When it is big, one needs to mold it hollow, & if you want to make it have an open mouth, put some <span class="m">cotton</span> inside, & then on the <span class="m">cotton</span> some <span class="m">melted wax</span>.
 
 
  

## Killing <span class="al">snakes</span> for molding

 
Some put a <span class="ms">drop</span> of <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> in their mouths, which makes it really drunk, such that the head & the part behind seem to be dead, but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it with a <span class="tl">needle</span> to fit it to the <span class="tl">mold</span>, it moves & spoils & undoes everything. Therefore, to kill them entirely, put it in a <span class="tl">bottle</span> of <span class="m">good vinegar</span> & some <span class="m">eau de vye</span>. And do thusly with <span class="al">lizards</span> & other similar beasts.

>   If you want to keep them, you can put them in a <span class="tl">pipe</span> full of <span class="m">earth</span> <span class="env">in a garden outdoors</span>. But your <span class="tl">pipe</span> must be covered with <span class="tl"><span class="m">archal wire</span></span>, for otherwise it would climb & go up very high.
