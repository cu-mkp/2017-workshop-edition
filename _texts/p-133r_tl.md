## Hard <span class="m">wax</span> to imprint seals

 
One makes these <span class="x">seals</span> out of white <span class="m">wax</span> which is harder than the other and one mixes in it some <span class="m">cerussite</span> or <span class="m">leaded white</span> very finely ground such that it is as hard as you like and mix in a drop of <span class="m">turpentine</span> to bind it. Afterwards mix it in the color that you want. It is in <span class="m">wax</span> that serves <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> for modeling.
 
 
  

## Casting the feet of small <span class="al">lizards</span> in <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>

 
Because the feet of these <span class="al"><span class="x">lizards</span></span> that are very small are <span class="x">also</span> very fine, once you have molded the top and you have uncover the vents and underneath the feet are covered lightly with <span class="m">wax</span>, and then cast a second mold. And the <span class="m">wax</span> that one removes, it leaves a little cast for these said feet, and again such that the underneath <span class="x">part</span> comes out in one piece that you can repair well, And the scales on top of the toes come <span class="x">out</span> well.

## Marks <span class="x">made by</span> the <span class="x">pin</span> points of <span class="m">iron</span> thread which one finds on the head of an animal

 
With the points <span class="x">or pins</span> with which you have dressed <span class="x">your animal</span> all over, do same with the head, but <span class="x">out of</span> the head which is pierced, a certain moisture seeps out around the wound and this little exudation prevents the sand from covering the point well and there always remain little pinpricks. But to avoid this, you can plant in the <span class="m">plaster</span> of the said blunt pin point and around the upper part of the point, and over this point, there put a little hard <span class="m">wax</span> or a little <span class="m">mastic</span> or <span class="m">cement</span>. And by the medium of the hot thread of <span class="m">iron</span> there you can hold the throat of the animal which one removes <span class="x">the <span class="m">iron</span></span> when you come to uncover the vents and the throat for doing the second cast.
 
 
  

## Clamps and the broken mold

 
When you have done the first firing and taken off the clamps and you have opened your mold to clean it by taking off the bubbles with <span class="m">quicksilver</span> which one cannot do with closed molds, reclose the mold and reattach the clamps but not in the same place as the first time. Reapply lute and dry it but if this is for casting <span class="m">silver</span> or <span class="m">gold</span> <span class="x">use</span> lute with the rest of sand which has been used because this is the best netting. If your mold is broken in refiring you can augment it with clamps and lute.
