## <span class="m">Sand</span>

 
I tried the <span class="m">bone of oxen <span class="add">feet</span>, very burned & pulverized</span> & ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, until it <span class="sn">is not felt between your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span></span>. It molds on its own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid & lean, it wants to be well moistened & dampened with <span class="m">wine boiled with <span class="pa">elm</span> root</span>.
 
<span class="m">Iron dross</span>, <span class="m">well burned bone of <span class="al">oxen</span> feet</span>, <span class="m">felt also well burned</span> over a closed fire, and all three very well ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span> mold very neatly in <span class="m">lead</span>, without needing to be reheated a lot, & casting <span class="del">le</span> <span class="add">in a</span> hot or cold <span class="tl">frame</span>.
 
<span class="m">Felt</span> alone molds very neatly once moistened & releases well, and also makes the other two release.

A <span class="m">fat metal</span> needs <span class="m">lean sand</span>.
 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Eau Magistra</span>

 
Some people think that <span class="m">salt water</span> is not good, because the <span class="m">salt</span> cracks in fire, & consequently should make it porous. a result causes bubbles. There is only <span class="m">wine boiled with <span class="pa">elm</span> root</span>.
 
<span class="m">Charcoal for poncer</span> makes for a good release, but one finds <span class="m">the one of <span class="pa">willow</span></span> make it porous. <span class="m">The one of <span class="pa">oak</span> or <span class="pa">beech</span></span> does well without making it porous.

## <span class="m">Lead</span>

 
For casting, there is only <span class="m">soft lead</span> that wants to be cast very <span class="del">g</span> hot, and <span class="m">soft tin</span>.
 
 
  

## Sand for <span class="m">lead</span>, the most excellent of all, for high and low reliefs

 
 I took <span class="m">ceruse</span> and crushed it dry on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, to make it very fine, then I moistened so much, with <span class="m">well beaten egg glair</span>, that it was like a paste, smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a <span class="tl">knife</span>. I left it a little.
