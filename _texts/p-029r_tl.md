## <span class="m">Stucco</span> for molding

 
Take <span class="m">tragacanth gum</span> and put it to soak until, having drunk its <span class="m">water</span>, it is swollen & rendered like <span class="m">jelly</span>. Then crush it quite hard on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> & next take <span class="m"><span class="pa">rye</span> flour</span>, which is better than <span class="m"><span class="pa">wheat</span></span> because it is more humid and does not make the paste as brittle, and sprinkle your <span class="m">tragacanth gum</span> with it, & continue to grind <span class="add">and mix in</span> thus, little by little, <span class="del">le et mesler legi</span> the very finely sieved <span class="m">flour</span>. And knead it as if you wanted to make <span class="m">bread</span>, until <span class="del">you</span> you perceive that it has enough body & is as firm as <span class="m">bread dough</span> that one is ready to put in the <span class="tl">oven</span>. This is perceivable when it can stretch enough without breaking. And if it was not strong enough, it would not <span class="del">sti</span> release well. Thus once prepared, rub the cavity <span class="del">au u</span> with <span class="m">oil</span>, with a <span class="tl">brush</span>, so that the <span class="m">oil</span> penetrates everywhere to make it release better, and press the paste inside quite hard. And if it does not release well, mix in more <span class="m">flour</span> until it has enough body. With this you will mold whatever work you like, masks or garlands, which will be dry within one <span class="ms">day</span>. Next, you will apply them with <span class="m">strong glue</span> or <span class="m">paste glue</span>, as you like, and you will be able to paint and decorate them with <span class="m">gold</span> & all colors. In <span class="pl">Rome</span> they make ceiling and wall ornaments with it. One can make bed ornaments with it. If you want that the work stays white, it is better to mold with <span class="m">plaster</span> instead of <span class="m">flour</span>. It is true that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare it like this: temper it, when it is powdered <span class="del">strong</span>, in a good amount of <span class="m">water</span> so that it is <span class="add">clear</span>, & grind it several times a day for fifteen <span class="ms">days</span>. Then pour <span class="m">water</span> at an angle, and gather the <span class="m">plaster</span> & grind it finely on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, & place it in some kind of clean <span class="tl"><span class="m">lead</span> vessel</span>, so that no dust & dirt falls into it, & leave it <span class="env">in the open air</span> & <span class="env">au serain</span> for fifteen <span class="ms">days</span> with its <span class="m">water</span>, and it will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making a groundlayer of burnished <span class="m">gold</span>. And this, when powder, you can mix, instead of <span class="m">flour</span>, with <span class="m">tragacanth gum</span>, and your work will be very beautiful. Lacking <span class="m">plaster</span>, you can mix in well ground <span class="m">chalk</span> or <span class="m">ceruse</span>, & try <span class="m">bole</span> & similar things. This <span class="m">stucco</span> with the <span class="m">tragacanth gum</span> has the quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either round or flat things, as you like. It is to make an ornament at little expense.
