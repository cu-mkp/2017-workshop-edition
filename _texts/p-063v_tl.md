In the <span class="tmp">month of May</span>, one puts the <span class="m"><span class="al">cow</span> dung</span> to putrefy under <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span> dung</span>. Then one mixes with <span class="m">floree</span>.

## Softening

 
If you have worked & made your ground layer with some desiccative color, such as <span class="m">minium</span> & similar, finish softening while the work is fresh, for if you were to wait until <span class="tmp">the next day</span>, it would be dry & you would not be able to finish it neatly.
