## Blacks

 
<span class="m">Black of charcoal from the mines</span>, of <span class="m">ordinary charcoal</span>, of <span class="m">burnt ivory</span>, of <span class="m"><span class="pa">peach</span> stones</span>, of <span class="m">lampblack</span>, of <span class="m">burnt bones of the feet of <span class="al">oxen</span></span>

 
  

## Shadows

 
When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.

 
  

## In fresco

 
<span class="m">Azure</span> is not good here, but bleak, & one needs to work with long <span class="tl"> longs pinceaux</span>. Fresco is not used <span class="del">cont</span> on <span class="m">wood</span>

 
  

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Turpentine oil</span> renders it very beautiful. Assay <span class="m">palma christi seed oil</span>. <span class="m"><span class="pa">Walnut</span> oil</span> in <span class="pl">Flanders</span> costs at least a hundred <span class="cn">sols</span> a <span class="ms">pint</span>. The <span class="m">azure</span> requires a little <span class="m">fatty oil</span> because it has no body.

>   <span class="m">Azur d’esmail</span> hates more than any other to be ground, especially with <span class="m">water</span>, for it dies & loses all its color. However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with <span class="m">water</span> but with <span class="m">oil</span> & grind it coarsely, and in this way it will not die as much.

## <span class="tl">Pinceaulx</span>

 
When the color has dried inside, & you want to clean them, soak them in <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> and they immediately will turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span>. <span class="m"><span class="pa">Walnut</span> oil</span>is not <span class="del">as not</span> as appropriate to soften them as the <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span></span> kind which is clear like <span class="m">water</span> & penetrates & does not have body like <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span>. The <span class="tl">handle of pinceaulx</span> is made by those who work with care from <span class="m"><span class="al">porcupine</span> quills</span>, by others from <span class="m"><span class="m">wood</span> of arrows from<span class="pl">Turkey</span></span> <span class="del">with whom</span> with which they also make <span class="tl">small rods to rest their <span class="bp">hand</span> when they are painting</span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*

> 
>   To work well on a small scale very thin <span class="tl">pinceaulx which have a firm point</span> are needed. And because the <span class="m">hair taken from the tail of a<span class="al">squirrel</span>'s fur</span> is mollesin, the most careful take the <span class="m">bristles of the oldest <span class="al">rats</span></span>, especially of <span class="al">dormice</span> if they can find them & put two or three of them in the middle of the <span class="tl">pinceau</span>. These make a straight line like a <span class="tl"><span class="m">quill</span></span> & all the other <span class="m">hairs</span> of the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> stick to them as to the point. The <span class="m">bristles of <span class="al">stone martens</span> & <span class="al">weasels</span> & small animals which make <span class="m">musk</span></span> are even better, for a single<span class="m">hair</span> in a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> suffices.
