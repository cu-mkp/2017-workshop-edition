## Moulding <span class="m">stucco</span> quickly

 
Grind & pulverize finely <span class="m">brick</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pl">Armenian</span> bole</span> or <span class="m">sanguine</span> & incorporate it with melted <span class="m">wax</span>, & thus melted, cast like the others on a <span class="tl">relief medal</span>, & thus you will have a cavity where you will be able to cast with <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="m">crushed paper</span> or <span class="m">terre chimolee</span>.

## Cleaning <span class="m">yellow pearls</span>

 
Gently boil them in the <span class="tl">bouteure of the <span class="pro">goldsmith</span></span> then, with <span class="m">tripoli</span> & a piece of <span class="m">leather</span>, sprinkled on the flesh side with the <span class="m">powder of the said tripoli</span>, rub & polish the <span class="m">pearl</span>.
 
 
  

## For whitening <span class="m">enilanroc</span>

 
Some think that the crust of <span class="m">ceruse</span> color which is natural on top, others say that it is a secret of <span class="pro">ancient lapidaries</span> that is lost, others say that it is <span class="m">reheated enamel</span>. And by means of the said crust, multiple ciphers, letters, circles <span class="del">st</span> & other bizarre things can be formed. As for the method, I have practiced thus. Once I wished to give it a layer of <span class="m">arsenic</span> ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>. However, I experimented without this, and I put the above said thing, <span class="m">enilanroc</span>, in a small <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> casket</span> on the fire of my <span class="tl"><span class="pro">goldsmith</span>'s forge</span> with three or four small half—burnt <span class="m">coals</span>, and blew only with my <span class="bp">mouth</span>. And, however, the thing came to <span class="del">redden &</span> ignite & became all white, not only on its surface but also inside, & at that time I let it cool on its own <span class="env">near the fire</span>, for otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have burst. Once all white, I passed it through my <span class="tl"><span class="add"><span class="m">lead</span></span> wheel</span> <span class="del">of <span class="m">tin</span></span>, where I found it as hard as before, & uncovering a little white, I found it a fair carnation. Finally, I polished it & saw that it took a very beautiful polish & could be compared to a very beautiful <span class="m">agate</span> for cutting some beautiful face on it & bringing it on <span class="del">the</span> a table of
