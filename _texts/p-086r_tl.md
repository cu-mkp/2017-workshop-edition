with the <span class="m">substance of a skillet</span> mixed with a knob that is <span class="m">potin</span>. And before that, I had so reheated my molded <span class="tl">frame</span>, now with the flame of my <span class="tl">furnace</span>, now putting lit <span class="m">charcoals</span> on top of it, that it became almost red. I let it cool and cast. It came out very neatly in relief on one side & in cavity on the other, as well for the figure as the letters. It is true that the material was whitish, as almost metallic, but this was because of the <span class="m">potin</span>. I made another cast with <span class="m">substance of skillet</span>, alone in the same sand, but not so reheated, it did not come out well.
 
Since then I molded the <span class="m">bone of <span class="al">oxen</span> feet, burned, pulverized</span>, & <span class="tl">sieved</span> through a <span class="tl">double sieve</span> & <span class="del">hum</span> <span class="del">fort</span> moistened with <span class="m">egg glair</span> or <span class="m">wine boiled with <span class="pa">elm</span> root</span>. I knocked on it moderately while molding. Having <span class="del">undone the</span>opened the <span class="tl">frame</span>, I found that the figures had not released neatly & left the <span class="tl">molds</span> floury—like & crumbling. I <span class="del">les</span> moistened the <span class="m">bone sand</span> further, so that it stuck together well <span class="del">in the </span> between my <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span>, and in this way, I molded neatly with a good release. And even though it seemed to me that the <span class="m">pulverised bone</span> was lumpy, if there is some <span class="m">substance of skillet</span> thrown in, my figures came out very neatly. It is true that I had very very reheated my <span class="tl">frame</span>, it withstood only one cast. I find that when a sand is so finely grounded that it renders itself dense as <span class="m">ceruse</span> & even, <span class="del">like</span> without knowing it to be arid, rarefied, <span class="m">areneux</span> & rather spongy, that it molds very neatly, but it does not receive <span class="m">metal</span> so well, as if it were porous to absorb the substance. But rather, once fat & even, it becomes porous & does not receive fine lines. I believe that the secret to cast well lies in finding a sand that receives the <span class="m">metal</span> well, one for <span class="m">lead</span>, the other for another, for each one has its particular one. Let it be molded slowly & scrupulously, and leave it for a few days to become compact by itself, if you have the time for this. And next, reheat it very well not all at once nor over with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it crumbles & always has some fault. Finally, you ought to cast the <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">latten</span> or other <span class="m">great metals</span> very hot, & if it possible in large quantities of substance, which contain more heat than small quantities. It is necessary that the <span class="tl">frame</span> be cold, & that you cast all at once. Always <span class="m">lute</span> the entrance of your <span class="tl">frame</span>, for the <span class="m">metal</span>, touching <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">metal</span>,
