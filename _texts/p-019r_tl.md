 of campaign. Faulconneau is to commonly loaded with a <span class="tl">linstock</span>. There are also some other faulconneaux weighing three <span class="ms">quintal</span>s, and which are nine <span class="ms">pan</span>s long. Their cannonball weighs half a pound. Their load is a quarter pound of <span class="m">powder</span>. They can be loaded with a <span class="tl">linstock</span>, but more commonly they are loaded with a charge. The breech is three cannonballs thick and the front two. The small pieces which are under three <span class="ms">quintal</span>s are at least three cannonballs and a twelfth of a cannonball thick at the breech, and the front thickness is sometimes reduced to get the proportion according to the length.

 A double musket weighs 2 <span class="ms">quintal</span>s and is seven <span class="ms">pan</span>s long. Its cannonball is a quarter of a pound or less. The breech is three cannonballs thick, and the front two. It is loaded with as much <span class="m">powder</span> as cannonballs, to the top of the touch line, which is equivalent for such small pieces to 3 or 4 arquebus <span class="m">powder</span> cannonballs, because if canon <span class="m">powder</span> is used, it can be loaded five cannonballs high.

>   This has to be understood as <span class="m">iron</span> cannonballs. When a metal cannonball is fired, we overload it with a quarter of <span class="tl"><span class="ms">linstock</span></span> because if a cannonball weighs 40 pounds, a metal one weights 60 pounds. This is why the sight is higher when a metal cannonball is fired. Because if an <span class="m">iron</span> cannonball is fired directly, a metal cannonball is shot from six lines higher. A metal cannonball, mixed with <span class="m">copper</span> to make it more brittle, is more effective at close range than the <span class="m">iron</span> one. But an <span class="m">iron</span> one is more effective at long range. 
 
 A simple musket weighs one <span class="ms">quintal</span> and is six <span class="ms">pan</span>s long. We disregard the ones that are less than two <span class="ms">quintal</span>s, and which usually throw lead cannonballs by its weight, and <span class="x">concentrate on those</span> which are loaded by caliber. However, those <span class="x">muskets</span> that can be loaded with metal or <span class="m">iron</span> cannonballs will work better, for they will do more damage than the <span class="m">lead ones</span>. It is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4 cannonballs thick. 
 
 Arquebus à croc weighs 60 pounds, the bigger one is five <span class="ms">panel</span>s long, it is loaded up to the touch line, which is 4 cannonballs thick; it is loaded with <span class="m">lead</span> cannonballs, and is for house's defence. These great and small arquebuses are used for to make orgues, appropriate for an assault outside and inside.They are casted separately in order to be used in various ways. See the 4th leaf marked.
