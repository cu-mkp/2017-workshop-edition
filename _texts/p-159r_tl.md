##  Portraits in <span class="m">Wax</span>

 
 If you do not mix your <span class="m">wax</span> with any color <span class="m">dye</span>, and if you paint some colors on the <span class="m">wax</span>, these colors would fade if you cast it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly with spirits diluted with hot <span class="m">water</span>. If your representations are varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to remove this <span class="m">varnish</span> which sticks to the mold. When the <span class="m">varnish</span> is removed, your mold is very clean. If your representation is set on <span class="m">wood</span>, it is necessary to pour very hot melted <span class="m">wax</span> on the <span class="m">wood,</span> otherwise the mold sticks to the <span class="m">wood</span>. It is much better to mix your white <span class="m">wax</span> with <span class="m">white lead</span> than <span class="m">ceruse</span>, because <span class="m">white lead</span> is whiter and more firm.
 
 
  

##  Chasing tool

 
 If a chasing tool has passed through any part of the representation, it is necessary to rework the whole thing and follow it all again. Otherwise it would look like an additional piece.
 
 
  

##  <span class="m">Fish glue</span>

 
 Beat it very finely and thinly on a wellâ€”cleaned anvil, then dilute your <span class="m">glue</span> with <span class="m">spirits</span>, put the mixture on hot <span class="m">ashes</span>, and on a low fire, it will melt very soon. If the <span class="m">glue</span> is not strong and thick enough, add <span class="m">spirits</span> in greater quantity. Do not melt it in a fatty <span class="m">pot</span>, but in a new <span class="m">pot</span> if possible. It melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire. When your <span class="m">glue</span> sets on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One reworks flowers and delicate things made from <span class="m">silver</span>, <span class="m">gold</span>, <span class="m">tin</span> and other <span class="m">metal</span> with this <span class="m">glue</span> which will not spoil your work.
 
 
  

##  <span class="m">Tin</span> and <span class="m">lead</span>

 
 They must be beaten out very finely and <span class="m">tin</span> will not get brittle or break, <span class="m">lead</span> is a bit fatter. But that is why it is necessary to reheat it under hot ashes, and to beat several leaves together.
