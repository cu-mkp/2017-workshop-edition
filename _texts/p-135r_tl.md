## Colors for <span class="m">gold</span>, or sauce

 
 Take as much <span class="m">verdigris</span> as <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, & <span class="m">saltpetre</span> the size of a bean. Because if you put in too much, it would make the whole thing boil so much that it would all pour out. <span class="m">Saltpeter</span> is only put in to make it boil, so that you know when the material has boiled enough. This color put on sour melted <span class="m">gold</span> makes it soft instantly.

## Casting

 
 It must be lengthened out with respect to the thing you have molded. And at a minimum for large molds it must be four or five fingers in length. You can make it large enough for half the mold & then divide it in three points of such a sort, and so the molded things will <span class="x">each</span> be small. But your points must be small. And in the middle of the casting & of its points, make some holes to impede the fury of the <span class="m">metal</span> & make it run more softly. It is also necessary to fix the bent parts of the animal with little notched lines, and similarly the end of the tail and other fine parts so that the <span class="m">metal</span> goes throughout & flows from one part to the other.
 
 Do not forget to make a wax cast of the paws of <span class="ill"></span> & things as subtle as this.

>   When you have molded an animal in the first part of the mold, do not let this part dry out before you have removed the said animal, because when the mold dries out it will shrink and it will also make the animal shrink. Keep it therefore in a damp & humid place until you have done it.

## <span class="m">Vine leaf</span> and small <span class="m">frog</span>

 
 To mold, take <span class="m">vine leaves</span> as they are blooming, just as with all <span class="m">herbs</span> & <span class="m">flowers</span>, or a young <span class="m">vine</span> regrowing after it has been cut or when the leaves come off in autumn, because new <span class="m">leaves</span> are knottier & have more evident veins. By contrast, old <span class="m">leaves</span> are smooth all the way through & full of holes in many places. Place therefore your <span class="m">leaf</span>, its back behind it against the <span class="m">clay plaster</span>, and fasten it with little pins. Leave it nevertheless with its natural curling. And make a notch in the clay to hide the stem for the first cast. And when it's done and dry, take out the stem of the <span class="m">leaf</span> and clean it well with your jacket and press it with a little scoop of clay. Afterwards, make many castings around the <span class="m">leaf</span> with <span class="m">wax</span>, as you know well, & make a slender casting & with many lines & knots.
