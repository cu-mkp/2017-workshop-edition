## Casting

 
 When you make a cast of delicate animals, like <span class="al">snakes</span>, start by casting the belly side, or the underâ€”tail, for this side has straighter lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more veined and is more marked.
 
 
  

## Repairing burrs

 
 Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small file, and rub with <span class="m">willow coals</span> and small brushes. Continue, also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Leaded</span> <span class="m">silver</span>

 
 A lot of <span class="sup"><span class="m">silver</span></span> is wasted because of the <span class="m">lead</span> which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the <span class="m">charcoal</span> which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt <span class="m">silver coins</span>, like reals and others, and make them into ingots prior to casting <span class="al">lizards</span> or <span class="al">animals</span>, for it comes out better. I cleanly molded a small, <span class="m">silver</span> <span class="al">viper</span>, like in the first <span class="sup">recipe above</span>. And at the end of the line of 4 <span class="m">reals</span> (of 20 S of <span class="pl">Spain</span>), and one <span class="m">coin</span> of 20 S from <span class="pl">France</span>.
 
 
  

## Blowing

 
 When you smelt <span class="m">silver</span> and <span class="m">gold</span> do not blow too hard or with force, because the <span class="m">charcoal</span> will become spent and the crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the <span class="m">silver</span> or <span class="m">gold</span>. When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top with a small bellows, doing the same for <span class="m">gold</span>, for it removes and reduces the smoke.
