## Tablets

 
Some are made from <span class="m">boxwood</span> inlaid with <span class="m">ebony</span>, <span class="m">sandalwood</span>, <span class="m">ivory</span>, or <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> like <span class="m">damascening</span>. Then one writes on it with <span class="tl">silverpoint</span>, and next erases it with a <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="al">cuttlefish</span> bone</span></span> by rubbing them.
 
 
  

## Making letters easier to read

 
One cuts the largest pieces of <span class="m">beryl</span> or <span class="m">crystal</span> round on one side and flat on the other, then one fits it with a little handle and puts the flat side on the letter
 
 
  

## Stamping

 
If you have some <span class="m">bronze</span> medal & you want to make it very light, make a hollow of <span class="m">lead</span> of it, then spread upon it a <span class="m">thin plate of gold</span>, or sheets of <span class="m">lead or annealed silver</span> <span class="del">recuit</span>, & set your <span class="m">bronze</span> medal on top & strike with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">wooden</span> mallet</span>.
 
 
  

## Softening <span class="m">horn</span>

 
 Those who mount <span class="del">acou</span> Agnus Deis and make circles from <span class="m">horn</span> for certain little boxes soften the said circles by soaking them in hot <span class="m">water</span> and then shape them on a round or ovalâ€”shaped <span class="tl">triblet</span>.
 
 
  

## Ears

 
When a defluxion occurs in the <span class="bp">ear</span>, be very careful not to put anything in it, and following the proverb, <span class="bp">ears</span> and <span class="bp">eyes</span> should only be touched with your <span class="bp">elbow</span>. However, to an affected <span class="bp">ear</span>, it is good to apply musky <span class="m">cotton</span>, that is to say, <span class="m">cotton</span> kept in <span class="pa">musk</span>, which comforts quite well.
 
 
  

## <span class="bp">Tooth</span>ache

 
Some put a clove of <span class="m">garlic</span> in the <span class="bp">ear</span> on the side of the aching <span class="bp">tooth</span>, and after two or three hours they feel better. Others put in their <span class="bp">nostril</span>, on the same side as the <span class="bp">tooth</span> that hurts, some green skin scraped from the stem of bisaube, namely that which is under the grey one that looks like a vine.
