The large canon is for great batteries and usually weighs fifty five or 60 <span class="ms">quintal</span>s. The breech is two cannonball and three quarters each. The mouth is one cannonball and three quarters each. It is thirteen or fourteen <span class="ms">pan</span>s in length. But they are very uneasy to drive. The proper battery, to be used rapidly and to have great impact, is a hundred fifty to two hundred <span class="ms">pace</span>s. It is true that a fair impact can be had from three or four hundred <span class="ms">pace</span>s, but more <span class="m">powder</span> is needed. Its usual load is 20 <span class="ms">pound</span>s of <span class="m">powder</span>; its cannonball weighs 40 <span class="ms">pound</span>s, and 25 <span class="al">horses</span> are required to carry it. When one needs a longer range than the usual one, half a <span class="ms"><span class="tl">linstock</span></span> of canon <span class="m">powder</span> is added. 80 or a hundred shots can be made with this canon per day, but it needs to be cooled down after each nine or ten shots if the battery is continuously used; if there are some breaks, it is not necessary to refresh it as often. For each <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">copper</span> — or one <span class="ms">quintal</span> and a half for big cannons — a <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">metal</span> is added. The <span class="m">metal</span> is composed of eight <span class="ms">pound</span>s of <span class="m">tin</span> for each <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">rosette</span> and even less for big bells for which we use only six <span class="ms">pound</span>s of fine <span class="m">tin</span> for a <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">rosette</span>, to give it a louder voice. Because the more <span class="m">tin</span> there is, the clearer the sound is. For canon founding, if the material and <span class="m">charcoal</span> is provided as it is usually done because <span class="pro">master</span>s cannot afford it, it costs 10 to 12 <span class="cn">pound</span>s per <span class="ms">quintal</span>. And when the <span class="pro">master</span> provides everything, you give him 40 <span class="cn">pound</span>s per <span class="ms">quintal</span> for big pieces such as cannons, according to the King's ordinance. And 50 <span class="cn">pound</span>s for smaller pieces. For the more matter there is, the more the <span class="pro">master</span> makes profit. Another kind of 30 <span class="ms">quintal</span>'s fowler is founded which is longer than the others, and usually 8 <span class="ms">pan</span>s long, which is used to attack fortifications and cassemattes by displaying them, at night, in groups on the moat's edge.

We give it two <span class="ms"><span class="tl">linstock</span></span> of cannon <span class="m">powder</span> for its load, and half a <span class="ms"><span class="tl">linstock</span></span> of arquebus <span class="m">powder</span> and the same for the others.

>   # The alloy of cannons from <span class="pl">France</span> is made of one <span class="ms">quintal</span> of metal for two of <span class="m">rosette</span>. But those of <span class="pl">Toulouse</span> and <span class="pn">Ponce</span>t put 3 <span class="ms">quintal</span>s of <span class="m">rosette</span> for one of metal.
 
 The <span class="m">rosette</span> used to remelt is better than <span class="m">rosette</span> for cauldrons, for the latter get all dirty.

>   The older pieces are composed of almost as much of each, that is to say a part of <span class="m">rosette</span> and one of metal. This alloy can be recognized with a <span class="tl">burin</span> because the matter is acid and the part scraped off with the <span class="tl">burin</span> is yellow and white.
