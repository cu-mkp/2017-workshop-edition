##  Mathematical figures without <span class="tl">ruler</span> or <span class="tl">compass</span>

 
 You know how to draw a circle correctly with the <span class="tl">quill</span> & or else with the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">nail of your right thumb</span></span> & the bent <span class="tl"><span class="bp">big finger</span></span>. If you do not have a <span class="tl">ruler</span>, fold <span class="m">paper</span> in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a <span class="tl">compass</span>, fold your <span class="m">paper</span> such that the fold <span class="del">e</span> gives you a straight line, at the required distance from which, trace a point <span class="del">& a</span> or a line & saturate it well with <span class="m">ink</span>. Then fold again the <span class="m">paper</span> & rub it on the back & it will stamp however much you have made. In that way <span class="del">la l</span>, A is the line without <span class="m">ink</span> which the <span class="m">paper</span> fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is stamped.

## <span class="del">P</span>For writing as well from the left as from the right

 
 Write as best you can with <span class="m">wellâ€”gummed ink</span> on as many little <span class="m">cards</span> as you want <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> to write words. & once each letter is well saturated with <span class="m">ink</span>, put it down on your <span class="m">paper</span> & rub with a <span class="tl">tooth</span> the back of the <span class="m">card</span>.
 
 
  

## Enemas

 
 They used to mount them with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">leather</span> handle</span> or <span class="tl">pocket</span>, the best one being of <span class="m"><span class="al">cat</span> pelt</span> which is more padded than any other else. And then they started to fold the <span class="tl">handle</span> from one side and then they kept folding it and turning it on itself and in that way enema runs slowly, but this manner takes more time and is less easy than a <span class="tl">syringe</span> which has been discovered since then with which a man can give to himself an enema. It is true that it always gives wind at the end.
