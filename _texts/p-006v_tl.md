## For cages

 
You can embellish them with <span class="m">thin</span> <span class="m">enamel</span> <span class="m">canes</span> of various colors by covering the <span class="m">yellow latten</span> or <span class="m">iron</span> wire with said canes. These you will break neatly into the length that you want if you make a small notch with a cutting <span class="tl">file</span> at the point where you want to break them, and they will not break anywhere else. You can bend them with a <span class="m">wood</span>en model over a brazier or by the heat of a <span class="tl">lamp</span>. A cane can be stretched out as long as you want in a small <span class="tl">furnace</span> made like a <span class="tl">reverberatory oven</span> but with openings on both sides. And once the large cane is red, they seize the hot end of it with <span class="tl">small pincers</span> that have long beaks, with one end of the beak inside the end of the cane, so that it may be stretched without becoming blocked. The other end of the cane is held with the hand, as it is not hot. Once the cane is stretched enough, the one who is working seated with his <span class="tl">stove</span>, the size of a carnation pot, placed in front of him, breaks it off and carries on. This is for making canes for capes, which may be cut, as already mentioned, with a <span class="tl">file</span>. <span class="pro">Glass—button makers</span> also use the said <span class="tl">stove</span>.

## For stamped ornaments used for embellishing and inserting into or covering the edges of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed valances

 
Etch with <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> on <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">copper</span> whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat with a <span class="tl">burin</span> or <span class="tl">chisel</span>. Then pour <span class="m">doulx tin</span>, yet unused, onto <span class="tl"><span class="m">polished marble</span></span> & flatten it, making it quite thin, with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">wooden</span> board</span>. Or else pour it on a <span class="tl">table</span> as is done with <span class="m">lead</span>, or put it through a <span class="tl">roll—press</span>. Next lay your <span class="m">tin</span> plate over the engraving, & over the <span class="m">tin</span> plate put a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">felt</span></span> and strike it with a <span class="tl">hammer</span>. Then <span class="m">gild</span> it in the following manner.
