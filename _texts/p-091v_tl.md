*[continued]*
  
since the two <span class="tl"><span class="m">bones</span></span> are joined, <span class="del">co</span> cut them evenly all around, & make notches <span class="del">e</span> around it in different places which cross over the joining of the two <span class="tl"><span class="m">bones</span></span>, in order to recognize well the place of the first joining. Or else, with little <span class="tl">shards of <span class="m">wood</span></span>, pierce them, or <span class="del">ma</span> coat the joinings with some <span class="m">clay</span>, & dry. Press <span class="del">between them</span> your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span> joined between your<span class="bp"> two </span>knees</span>; & not with a <span class="tl">press</span>, because the <span class="tl"><span class="m">bones</span></span> would burst. Mold also at your leisure & two or three times, until you see that it is well pressed tightly together & well imprinted. And each time before replacing the piece, ponce with some <span class="m"><span class="pa">willow</span> charcoal</span>, for it makes it release well. When you have cast, rub the medal with <span class="m">oil</span> & with <span class="m"><span class="pa">willow</span> charcoal powder</span> & with a <span class="tl">brush</span>, to make it dull. Guard against your medal being too greasy or <span class="m">oily</span>, when you mold in <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="al">cuttlefish</span> bone</span></span>. When you have cast, leave it to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it brings with it some <span class="tl"><span class="m">bone</span></span>. And, cast moderately hot, something you will know when the <span class="tl"><span class="m">bone</span></span> is about to change its <span class="del">good</span> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes the <span class="tl"><span class="m">bone</span></span> red. The <span class="ms">proportion</span> of <span class="m">lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult to come out, & of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or four grooves, <span class="del">and make</span> & direct these grooves to the place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like directly on the head, for this attracts the <span class="m">metal</span> & absorbs the figure best. Shake your <span class="tl">frame</span> a little when you have cast, and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <span class="m">Tin</span> that is too hot burns the <span class="tl"><span class="m">bone</span></span>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken out <span class="del">du mo</span>hot from the <span class="tl">mold</span>, it risks breaking.
