## For making very beautiful gold color & of little expense

 
First take very yellow <span class="m"><span class="pa">orange</span> peel,</span> & clean them well of the white that is inside, & pulverize them very well <span class="del">and</span> <span class="add">in</span> a very clean <span class="tl">mortar</span>. And take as much of <span class="m">sulphur</span>, & grind all together, and put everything in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> vial</span>, & keep them <span class="env">in the cellar or other damp place</span> for the space of eight or ten <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>. Then when you want to use it, one needs to warm it and use it where you want, & you will see a very beautiful color.

## Gilding iron or tin

 
First it is necessary to wash whatever one wants to gild in wine lees, and then wash it once again with white wine. Take three ounces of terra merita and one choppine of white wine. Boil the matter for half an hour, and apply your colors over your iron or tin, or whatever else. Then leave to dry on a sheet of paper and do not put your hand in your materials.
