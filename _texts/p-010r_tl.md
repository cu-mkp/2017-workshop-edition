## <span class="m">Counterfeit jasper</span>

 
Take <span class="m">horn</span> from which one makes lanterns, quite thin, & underneath make the figure of your <span class="m">jasper</span>, <span class="m">cornalines</span>, & other <span class="m">stones</span>, which will be a work more appropriate than on <span class="m">glass</span>, which is too shiny. And the <span class="m">horn</span> presents a lustre & a fatty polish like <span class="m">jasper</span>.
 
You know, as with scrapings of the said <span class="m">horn</span>, the <span class="m"><span class="pa">roses</span></span> can be imitated. The <span class="del">horn</span> colors for this <span class="m">jasper</span> wants to have a base with <span class="m">clear turpentine</span> or <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> varnish</span>. <span class="add">And colors matte in body are not so appropriate here, however beautiful they are.</span> <span class="add">One needs to <span class="m">oil</span> the unpainted reverse with <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>.</span>

>  Thin <span class="m">glass</span>, for this effect, is very beautiful.

>  You can encrust beds with it & on the joints you can throw the <span class="m">filings of talc or of pins</span> on the fresh <span class="m">cement</span> of the said joints. One needs to join them with <span class="m">gum ammoniac</span> mixed in <span class="m">vinegar</span>. To better counterfeit <span class="m">marbled jasper</span>, apply <span class="m">wool of thick hairs</span> dyed in diverse colors & intermingled. After you have laid down all the colors, scrape oblique lines on them, then lay down <span class="m">gold &silver leaf</span>. If you lay down on the <span class="m">horn</span> colors of <span class="m">turpentine</span>, give it a base of <span class="m">silver</span> or of <span class="m">tin leaf</span>. You can also <span class="tl">file</span> <span class="m">horn</span> & mix it with <span class="m">strong glue</span>, & lay it down onto the joints of the piece of <span class="m">horn</span>, then even it with a <span class="tl">plane</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Stil de grain yellow</span>

 
It is made in <span class="pl">Lyon</span> from the <span class="m">juice of weld</span> & <span class="m">chalk</span> mixed together or better yet with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, which is appropriate for <span class="m">distemper</span> and <span class="m">oil</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="pa">Roses</span>

 
These are counterfeited either with the scrapings of <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> <span class="m">horn used for lanterns</span>, or with scrapings of <span class="m">parchment</span>, very clear, delicate & dyed, employed as you know.
 
 
  

## Purple color

 
<span class="pro">Painters</span> make it beautifully by making the first layer of <span class="m">common azur</span>, or better yet <span class="m">azur d'esmail</span>, & next they glaze it with <span class="m">lake</span>, which will be more appropriate for this if you mix in <span class="m">alum</span>, which gives it a violet tint depending on the quantity that you mix in.
 
 
  

## Powder for hourglasses

 
It is made very subtle & not subject to rust &by its weight able to flow. Taking i <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">lead</span>, melt it and skim and purify it from its filth, then pour into it four ℥ of finely pulverized <span class="m">common salt</span>, and take good care that it has no <span class="m">stones</span> nor earth. And immediately after you have poured it, mix continuously very well with an <span class="m">iron</span> <span class="sup">tool</span> until the <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">salt</span> are well incorporated, and take it immediately from the fire, stirring continuously. And if it seems too coarse, grind it on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> and pass it through a fine <span class="tl">sieve</span>, then wash it as many as times as necessary until the <span class="m">water</span> becomes clear, throwing out the fine powder that will float on it, renewing the <span class="m">water</span> as many times as necessary until it is all even.
