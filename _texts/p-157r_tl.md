## The mode in which <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> mold hollow molds

 
 They mold their animal, or another solid work that they have already made or rough—hewn in <span class="m">wax</span> and cast in <span class="m">lead</span>, in two cuttlefish bones. When it is good and impressed in the two cuttlefish bones, they put a piece of <span class="m">paper</span> between the two bones & join the bones and cast. The work comes in parts by halves. And then with a chaple they excavate the two half castings of <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span> as subtly as they like, and then they solder or braze them.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Rouge cler</span>

 
 Some <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> assay it on <span class="m">thinly beaten <span class="del">esp</span> gold</span> & that is well <span class="tl">burnished</span> with a <span class="tl">chaple</span>. But it is better to assay it on a <span class="m">gold ingot</span>. And also assay your substances in large or fantastical work, since if they appear good & extraordinary in large work, they will show excellently on a common work.
 
 
  

## Flies 

 
They mold better on a single leaf than on a bouquet or a flower or the branch of an herb, since the single leaf is molded in two halves that being reheated can be opened up and cleaned well, & the cast will be better. In picking up the fly, take heed that you do not break its legs or let it dry out too much, because then the legs will fall off. And if this happens to you, glue the same legs back on with <span class="m">fish glue</span> and <span class="m">wax</span>, or adapt the <span class="m">hairs of a pig</span> or the <span class="m">cords of a spinet</span>. Fix the leaf on a flat piece of <span class="m">clay</span> with two pins, and the fly with one pin in the middle of its body & the feet with wax.
 
 
  

## Cleaning and degreasing your cast <span class="m">tin</span> works, and others

 
Make some lye passed through scrupulously with good <span class="m">ashes</span>, and it should be new & without any fat; boil your molded work in it. And the tallow and fat will leave.
 
 
  

## Arranging an herb or flower to cast

 
 Always put the front side of the thing on the upper side because it will come out better and neater than the lower side. Make the casting large & prepare the supraplus, which is the mass, after the <span class="pro">founders</span> of large castings, even for <span class="m">silver</span>, which needs a very hot mold & is cast very hot. Very fine thing must be cast very hot.
