## Animals oven dried for a long time

 
 Stick your animals on a slab of <span class="m">earth</span>, fix them with sharp pointed iron wires, as if you wanted to mold them, then dry them into an oven as hot as when <span class="m">bread</span> has been taken out. It is the same for <span class="al">snakes</span>, <span class="al">birds</span> and other animals. But they have to be promptly dried.

Leave it there one day and one night in order for them to be very dry, otherwise it would stink. However, be sure that the oven is not too hot, it should be as warm as the sun in June, otherwise the animals would cook. Once they are dry, do not soak them; clean them with a brush or a paintbrush.
 
 
  

## Animals casted in <span class="m">copper</span>

 
Once casted in <span class="m">copper</span>, try to burnish them as we do with leaves made from gem, to see if they will get the same color.
 
 
  

## Advice about casting

 
Be careful that your cast is not too thick, and do not forget to make 2 or 3 holes and notches in the conduit, when your cast is coming near the molded thing, divide it between 3 or 4 parts like fingers, and not deep. Thus the metal will run more gently, without preventing vapors and smoke.

 To cast a <span class="al">spider</span> on a leaf, and to prevent the sand from covering the under belly, fix a bit of melted <span class="m">wax</span> at the end of its tail, and bottom part of the body, with the help of a warm wire as you know. Once the leaf has burnt and the <span class="m">wax</span> has melted, two small holes remain on the leaf, that will be the cast of the <span class="al">spider</span>.
 
 
  

## Casting a spider on a leaf

 
 Usually big spiders have hairy legs, which are difficult to mold if you do not lay hairs down flat, or if you don't burn them with the flame of a candle, or if you stiffen them and lay them flat by <span class="m">oiling</span> them with <span class="m">wheat oil</span>. Kill them into <span class="m">vinegar</span> and <span class="m">urine</span>, like <span class="al">snakes</span>, or in <span class="m">spirits</span>. Then arrange your them on a beautiful vine leaf, or another leaf, then you can make the undisciplined hair look like tamed hair by rubbing them with mouth glue, or something similar. Their true color is <span class="m">vinegar</span> or greenish. And season with sulphur in random places. Arrange your slab of <span class="m">clay</span> and place your vine leaf on it, your dead spider in the middle. Pierce the middle of the <span class="al">spider</span>'s body with the tip of an <span class="m">iron</span> or <span class="m">latten</span> wire. Then fix diagonally some small <span class="m">latten</span> tacks all around the vine leafs in order to secure it. Then block the end of the legs with a bit of melted wax using a warm <span class="m">iron</span> wire, and smooth it out with the tip of a pair of small pincers. do the same with the other edges of the <span class="al">spider</span>.

Then arrange the disc of earth around the spider, and cast your soaked sand, as you did for others. In this fashion you will have to burn the vine leaf in the mold. Otherwise, you will not have to. To cast your <span class="al">spider</span> more easily, make sure the animal is dead, avoiding the entanglement of its legs while agonizing. When you have done your first cast, peel this side of the leaf, then do the second cast.
