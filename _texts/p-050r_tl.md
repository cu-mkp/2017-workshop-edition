## Preserving fruit for the entire year

 
Take a rounded <span class="m">glass</span> phial, with a large enough opening to receive cherries and plums and whatever fruit you want. Put in some <span class="m">hot water</span> <span class="sup">and leave it</span> for two hours, and once your <span class="m">water</span> is cold, throw it out and turn the phial upside down onto its opening on a perfectly even table and in a room where there is not a bit of draft or wind. Then prepare a stopper of fresh <span class="m">wax</span>, wrapped in <span class="m">oilcloth</span>, and adapt it precisely to the <span class="m">glass</span> phial so that it will be ready to stop it once you have put in the fruit. And once you have hand—picked the fruit, only the non—rotten fruit, and on a warm and dry day, withdraw to the room, well closed so that no wind or draft can get in, and put it gently and deftly in the bottle. Then stop the bottle well with the stopper and lute it, making your lute, if you want, with some <span class="m">quicklime</span> and <span class="m">oil</span>, so that no <span class="m">water</span> gets in. Then put your bottles into a tub full of <span class="m">water</span>, in a cellar, during the summer, and in the winter put your bottles into a basket filled with some weights and lower it to the bottom of a deep well. Because in the winter the <span class="m">water</span> in the tub would be too cold if your cellar is not warm enough, because the <span class="m">water</span> needs to be like <span class="m">river water</span>.

 
  

## Molding

 
If you want to promptly mold something in demy relief that comes to hand, fold some <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> in five or six doubles, & place it on the <span class="tl">medal</span> & make sure the <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> is folded on the back of the <span class="tl">medal</span> so that it is well secured. Next take a <span class="tl">stick</span>, broad at one end & pointed at the other, well softened and rub well on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span>, &with the point of the <span class="tl">stick</span> retrace the lines & proceed until you recognize that your impression is well done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub <span class="m">oil</span> with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> <span class="del">lemp</span> on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">>paper</span></span> impression and cast in <span class="m">tallow</span> or <span class="m">wax</span> or <span class="m">sulphur</span>, & the <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span>, without it burning, will render your design neat, so that you will be able to mold it later in <span class="m">plaster</span> or <span class="m">tripoli</span>, and then in <span class="m">lead</span> & other <span class="m">metal</span>.

> Polished <span class="tl"><span class="m">cardboard</span></span> of little thickness & a little moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with <span class="tl"><span class="m">papier collé</span></span> on the back.
