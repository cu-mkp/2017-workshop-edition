## Cleaning the <span class="tl">bowl</span> and the <span class="tl">spoon</span> that one uses to temper sand

 
Be very careful to clean, vigorously & quickly after casting, your <span class="tl">bowl</span> & your <span class="tl">spatula</span> or <span class="tl">spoon</span> with which you temper your sand, because if it dries, it crumbles & falls into the fresh sand & makes a hole or fault get made. Also, when the <span class="tl">mold</span> gets reheated, these little pieces will chip & flake off & prevent neat casting. 

 
  

## Molding hollow

 
<span class="m">Wax</span> on its own cools down too rapidly & does not spread well everywhere, & <span class="m">tallow</span> holds its heat & spreads everywhere; but is not good on its own. But when <span class="m">wax</span> and <span class="m">tallow</span> are mixed the work behaves well. The bodies of <span class="m">crawfish</span> & other small animals can easily be molded hollow, but as for the legs, it will be troublesome.

## Molding medals and flat things

 
You are not limited to making the gate with legs thus

 , but rather in this way

 , which embraces the medal well. For the other way with legs is only done to accommodate more delicate works and the other, which is wide and in one piece works better for flat medals. But take heed that all gates need to be very thin close to the medal & so as to say not as thick as the medal, if it is not very thin like paper. And then, from the medal out towards the opening of the gate, make it thicker and thicker for it works better thus. If the gate is thick at the entry to the medal, the work never comes out very well. Make that <span class="del">despuys</span> from the middle to the top of the gate be moderately thick, & from the same middle to the bottom very thin. Do not forget to makes grooves in <span class="del">au hau</span> the top of your gate to prevent the <span class="m">metal</span> from spreading furiously.
