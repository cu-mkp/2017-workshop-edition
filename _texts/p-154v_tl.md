## <span class="m">Latten</span>

 
<span class="m">Latten</span> is wonderful to cast. It is necessary to be cast very hot. And to master it better, throw in some <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> to clarify it. You can also add a bit a <span class="m">red copper</span>, and if you wish to, add in a bit of <span class="m">tin</span> to make it runnier. It always leaves filaments like melted <span class="m">glass</span>. It does not require as long of a cast as others.

 
  

## Moulding

 
It is a good thing that it be cooled on the outside, but nevertheless remain hot on the inside, because when it comes out of the fire, the air and the strong fumes from the fire do not reheat the cast well. 

 
  

## Casting <span class="m">silver</span>

 
<span class="m">Silver</span> requires a long cast, whereas for <span class="m">gold</span> it does not matter. <span class="m">Silver</span>, when soldering, withstands the <span class="m">water</span> you throw at it. Whereas <span class="m">gold</span> sizzles, and because of this one throws its ? on the <span class="m">solder</span>.

>  Let the mold cool well after the casting, rather than opening it.

 
  

## Strengthening flowers and delicate things

 
For flowers and small plants, do not use <span class="m">wheat oil</span>. Instead, use some melted <span class="m">butter</span> which you will apply lightly with a small brush on the back of the rose leaves, and pansies and any other flower that needs it. But one reinforces the little feet of <span class="al">flies</span> and other small animals with <span class="m">wheat</span> oil to make them stronger and hold up.
 
 
  

## Strawberries 

 
The leaves are cast separately and then rejoined with solder. And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid, and because of this it is heavy, and the <span class="m">tin</span> stem is slender, it will not be able to sustain <span class="sup">weight</span> without breaking quickly. One makes the stems with <span class="m">latten</span> thread and then solder them back onto the fruit.
