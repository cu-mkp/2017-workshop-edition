## <span class="pro">Pewterers</span>

 
They deem the best <span class="m">tin</span> is the one that comes in saulmons, which has not been remelted since it came from the <span class="env">mine</span>, because the masters remelt it <span class="del">a</span> in <span class="tl">grilles</span>, weighing two or three <span class="ms">lb</span>, to easily cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often mix in leftovers from <span class="m">plates</span>, <span class="m">soldering</span> & <span class="m">common tin</span>. And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their saulmons they find pieces of <span class="m">iron</span>, stones, & similar things mixed in, to cheat on the weight. The <span class="m">tin from <span class="pl">England</span></span> is so hard that the <span class="pro">miners</span> put in <span class="m">lead</span> to soften it. The one that comes by way of <span class="pl">Germany</span> is softer. Usually, the <span class="pro">sworn master pewterers</span>, from <span class="env">bonnes villes</span>, add six <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">fine lead</span> <span class="del">on</span> or eight on a <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">fine tin</span>. The <span class="pro">others, who work in the <span class="env">countryside</span></span>, put fifteen or 20 or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness of the <span class="m">lead</span> <span class="del">they</span> and its softness, they put in <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>, 4 <span class="ms">lb</span> per <span class="ms">quintal</span>, \+, <span class="del">po</span> which whitens & hardens, and <span class="del">a little</span> six or eight <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">rosette</span> on a quintal to render the plate <span class="sn">sonorous</span>. 
 
 To mold platters & dishes, they make them out of <span class="m">pierre <span class="del">porte</span> morte</span>, that is from <span class="m">grais</span>, & they shape &polish <span class="del">around</span> them on the <span class="tl">wheel</span>. They melt their <span class="m">tin</span> in an <span class="del">dest</span> <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> posnet</span> on a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire, and with an <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> spoon</span> that holds <span class="del">almost</span> a sufficient quantity for a platter, they cast <span class="del">leu</span> in their <span class="tl">cold molds</span>, which they keep joined & tight between their <span class="bp">knees</span>. And soon after, they open the <span class="tl">molds</span> so that they do not heat up, & having taken out the cast which is on the female side, & which breaks easily. Then, with a <span class="tl">cloth</span> which soaks in <span class="m">water</span>, which they always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back of the dish & around the edge, so that it comes out better, and they rub the female mold.

>   \+ When the <span class="m">tin is fine</span>, one adds less <span class="m">glass—looking tin</span>, namely 4 <span class="ms">lb</span> per <span class="ms">quintal</span>, but if the <span class="m">tin is low quality</span>, that is to say allied with a lot of <span class="m">lead</span>, one puts at least five or six <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> to it.
 
 If there is not a lot of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span>, one puts about two or three <span class="ms">lb</span> per <span class="ms">quintal</span>. One puts eight <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">rosette</span>. But if there is a lot of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> <span class="del">one</span>, like 4 or 5 <span class="ms">lb</span>, one only puts six of <span class="m">rosette</span>. And commonly, per <span class="ms">quintal</span> of <span class="m">tin</span>, one adds x <span class="ms">lb</span> of both.
