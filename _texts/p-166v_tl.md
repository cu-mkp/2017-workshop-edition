In addition to Greek examples, there is a psalm of David mentioned by Saint Athanasius in the Synopsis. It begins Parvus eram and in the second verse the royal prophet says, Manus meae fecerunt organum et digiti mei aptarunt psalterium.
 
 
  

## Keeping <span class="m">chestnuts</span>

 
They must be left in their burs until you want to eat them. And in their burs, store them in a humid place, or in the drain of some roof.
 
 
  

## Scented <span class="m">candle</span> from <span class="pl">Le Mans</span>

 
They melt in with <span class="m">wax</span> and <span class="m">candles</span> <span class="m">rosin</span> that is called in <span class="pl">France</span> <span class="x">rosin</span> from <span class="pl">Burgundy</span>, which is white and not as rough or dry as the other <span class="m">rosin</span>. They also perfume the wick and the end of the wick.
 
 
  

## Softening <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Dissolve some <span class="m">caput mortuum</span> in distilled <span class="m">vinegar</span>. Filter and congeal in salt and cement the <span class="m">☉</span> with this, and it will soften wonderfully.
 
 
  

## Improve the color of <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Put <span class="m">aqua fortis of vitriol</span> on hot ashes. Cover the <span class="tl">bottle</span>, that is, the mouth, with a <span class="tl">tile</span>, then unstop it & a <span class="m">thick smoke</span> will come out; put the <span class="m">gold</span> on this and it will take on a high color.
