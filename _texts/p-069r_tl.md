Three things take the longest, leaves, hair & garlands.
 
 
  

## Sand

 
You should not choose for casting the one that is in any way lean & arid, such that it does not bind at all, like <span class="m">the one from the <span class="env">sea</span></span> or <span class="del">desei</span> <span class="m">from <span class="env">sandy paths</span> dried out by the <span class="env">sun</span></span>. But <span class="add">choose</span> them <span class="del">or in t</span> preferably from <span class="env">quar<span class="del">reries</span>ries</span> or <span class="env">rock caves</span>, because that one is best, as long as it is very fine. You will know the vein if, in the greyish <span class="env">rocks</span> or <span class="env">quarries</span> <span class="del">qu</span> that seem to be made of <span class="m">arene</span>, you see <span class="tmp"><span class="env">after rainy weather</span></span>, certain little amounts like dust attached to the said <span class="env">rocks</span>, or if a little piece flakes off, easily crushed between your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span>, due to humidity. You will also find it in <span class="m">lean soils</span>, which comes off in <span class="del">lop</span> large lumps like <span class="m">stones of tuf</span> <span class="del">et ne</span>, or among <span class="m">terres <span class="pl">boulvènes</span></span>, which are much better than those from <span class="m">fat & strong earths</span>. And one ought not to take it from the surface, for fear that it be mixed with <span class="m">common earth</span>, but three or 4 <span class="ms"><span class="bp">feet</span></span> below & the closest to the <span class="m">tuf</span> or <span class="m">stone</span>. Since it comes out in large lumps one would say it starts to form itself in stone. But when it is wet, it comes apart easily. One needs to make sure that when breaking it up it is well granular, & that when crushing it between the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span>, it renders itself really very fine, <span class="del">like impalpable</span>, keeping nevertheless its asperity of <span class="m">arene</span>, without <span class="m">muddying</span> the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> like <span class="m">clay</span>. It dries up slightly on the fire, then it disintegrates & passes finely through a <span class="tl">double sieve</span> or a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span> sleeve</span>, then takes moistures with <span class="m">wine</span> or <span class="m">magistra</span> & @ / Verte

He makes the cast very broad & <span class="del">ne</span> flat & barely deep. He casts <span class="m">pure latton used for scales</span> & similar thin things. He casts very hot.
