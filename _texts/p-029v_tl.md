## Color of gold without <span class="m">gold</span> on <span class="m">silver</span>

 
Color your applied <span class="m">silver leaf</span> with <span class="m">terre emerita</span>, and once dry, give a coat of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil varnish</span> and of <span class="m">sandarac</span>. And it will be more beautiful than <span class="m">tinsel</span>.

 
  

## Layer of <span class="m">burnished gold</span> on <span class="m">paper</span>

 
Make your ground layer of <span class="m">starch</span> soaked in <span class="m">water</span> & your <span class="m">gold</span> will burnish very well. <span class="m">Clear starch water</span> layered on the <span class="m">paper</span>, then dried, & repeated in this manner 3 times, is a good layer for <span class="m">burnished gold</span> on simple <span class="m">paper</span> & has no body.

 
  

## Removing stains

 
A good <span class="m">eau de vie</span> takes it off if you rub your <span class="m">cloth</span> with it.

 
  

## Ground layer of <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Ground <span class="m">terra emerita</span> with some <span class="m">saffron</span>, all of it mixed with very clear <span class="m">colle forte</span> & passed through a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span> cloth</span>.

 
  

## Extraction of <span class="m">oils</span>

 
<span class="pro">Apothecaries</span> say that anything with does not adhere to the <span class="tl">mortar</span> while being ground is oleaginous.

 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="al">Dragon</span>'s blood</span>

 
Take a well chosen tear of it which shows off its transparent red. And in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> bottle</span> put the best <span class="m">eau de vie</span> you can find, in sufficient quantity. <span class="del">For it</span> And stopper it well and so quickly that it does not evanesce, otherwise it would be worth nothing. And leave it thus for <span class="ms">a long time</span>, because the longer it stays <span class="del">there</span>, the more beautiful & better it will be & it will dissolve if it is good, otherwise it will become like <span class="m">lees</span>. When you want to use it, make a small hole in the <span class="tl">stopper of the bottle</span> & pour a little & stopper it again each time, then apply it on <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
The good kind of <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span> can be found in large pieces like <span class="m">torteau</span><span class="add">this one has no value and is adulterated</span> & once broken it shows on its edges scales, transparent as <span class="del">ro</span> <span class="m">rouge clair enamel</span>, it is also lumpy in some parts like small <span class="m">rubies</span>. The <span class="m">eau de vie</span> nees to be very afrdent & passed several times.

>   The darker <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span> is the best & has more of a tint; the tear is found in <span class="del">gr</span> pieces like <span class="m"><span class="pa">peas</span></span> and large <span class="m"><span class="pa">hazelnuts</span></span> which look like

>   I put it in <span class="m">common eau de vie</span>, mixing in some <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> to give it strength. At the beginning the <span class="m">water</span> took on a slight tint, but at the end there was only an appearance of <span class="m">tragacanth gum</span> with which I think they adulterate the <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span>.

>   When it is applied on <span class="m">burnished gold</span>, it is prone to break. For this reason, some coat it with <span class="m">turpentine varnish</span>. Cold delays the action of the <span class="m">water</span> and the extraction of the color. And for this reason, you can keep it by the fire.
