## <span class="pro">Perfume—makers</span>

 
They readily make their perfumes with half <span class="m">amber</span> and half <span class="m">musk</span>, and a little <span class="m">civet</span>, because the scent of <span class="m">amber</span> is stronger than the scent of <span class="m">musk</span>.
 
To save using <span class="m">amber</span>, <span class="pro">perfume—makers</span> readily add add a small quantity of <span class="m">musk</span> to the white layers, in order to get a stronger scent. But to remove or hide the blackness of <span class="m">musk</span>, they add a bit of <span class="m">starch</span> from <span class="pl">England</span>, which is perfectly white.
 
To give off a scent of <span class="m">white amber</span>, in the same way that the <span class="pl">Portuguese</span> do, take a chunk of <span class="m">amber</span> that you have broken up into pieces. Having put in a small <span class="m">silver</span> porringer a spoon of <span class="m">flower oil</span>, should you not have some, <span class="m">linseed oil</span>. That is to say, use the type of <span class="m">silver</span> spoon one might use at the table. Pour into this your <span class="m">ambergris</span>, then place it on a low fire, it will melt quickly if your <span class="m">amber</span> is of good quality, and there will be no lumps. Having melted it all, put in a small bit of <span class="m">civet</span>, and melt it all and blend it well together. Then take your gloves which you have cleaned and dried properly, and lightly dip the edge of your finger around the edge of the <span class="m">oil</span>, with patience slowly spread the <span class="m">oil</span> along the glove, and rub the glove between your hands and trace along the fingers and its stitches, one after the other. Leave it to dry. Then repeat the previous procedure until you have used up all of the <span class="m">amber</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Spirits</span>

 
<span class="m">Spirits</span> are excellent for making molds clean, in such a way that where you do not apply some, common sand will attack the figure. But it needs to be passed three times. And because it does not take well on oiled things, I believe it may be best to put some into the <span class="m">water</span> with which you have moistened your sand.
