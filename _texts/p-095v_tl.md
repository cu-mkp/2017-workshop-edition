The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some <span class="m">resin</span> or <span class="m">glue</span> but the <span class="m">resin</span> is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered <span class="m">resin</span> on the end melts, in that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in fire.
 
Hilts are of different types: Ornate Guttered which is with round mouldings <span class="m">Pearled</span> Scarfed when the bands are crosswise Onioned which is with a flat head In the King's manner, fully covered

Then the <span class="pro">furbisher</span> puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small <span class="m">iron</span> tool similar to the <span class="pro">joiners</span>' bench, they maintain it firmly. Then with a plane, which is like a twoâ€”handled knife, they work the <span class="m">wood</span> piece from the top, then use the <span class="pro">joyner</span>'s plane to flatten it more. Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a
