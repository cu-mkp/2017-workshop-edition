## Casting <span class="m">red copper</span>

 
Pure cauldron <span class="m">red copper</span>, or <span class="m">copper</span> of any other small works, is good to cast. To make it runny, add some <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> to it, and when you are about to cast, add a little bit of <span class="m">fine tin</span>. One must cast the <span class="m">copper</span> very hot into the mold, so that it is burning and very red, like <span class="m">gold</span>, <span class="m">silver</span>, <span class="m">latten</span>, and <span class="m">metal</span>. You will know that it is hot enough when it is clear and shining like a newly polished <span class="m">steel mirror</span>, or like <span class="m">melted silver</span>. Protect it from wind so that it doesn't cool down too soon. Cover your cast with tow in order to prevent it from cooling down. <span class="m">Red copper</span> is cleaner than <span class="m">latten</span>, which smokes a lot, which prevents the metal from running. I have moulded it as a noyau very neatly, and as thin as a piece of <span class="m">paper</span>. It must be very hot, white and shining like melted <span class="m">silver</span>, or a mirror. I have moulded it as a noyau with the same <span class="m">sand</span> mentioned above.

## <span class="m">Huile tingente</span> to make metal runny

 
Take some <span class="m">mercury</span>, some real <span class="m">sublimate of Venice</span>, and not <span class="m">sublimate of arsenic</span>, <span class="m">aes ustum</span> a poix, <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, a poix. Ground everything separately, then blend them together in a <span class="m">glass</span> bottle, and put it on warm ashes. You will see that everything melts like <span class="m">wax</span>, and will have bright colors. Leave to set, add a small quantity of this mixture on every metal, it will run marvelously.

>   <span class="pro">Foundry workers</span> who make large casts to mold statues, clean the dirt from these molds with <span class="m">calamine</span>, and a lot of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> in order to make moulds clear and neat. When they want to cast they add a lot of <span class="m">tin</span>. Dampness and cold could spoil their works, that is the reason why even a small source of <span class="m">water</span> in the hole can damage the whole thing.
 
 
  

## Clamps

 
To make clamps use flat tongs made from wire, which is reheated and bent, and hammered on anvil. Since those clamps are thinner, they burn more easily, being used in reheated molds. So use new clamps.
