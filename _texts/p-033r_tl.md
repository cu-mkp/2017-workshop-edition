This is a <span class="tl">well—furbished knife</span>, <span class="tl">nailed</span> through the middle in such a way that it easily moves to one side & the other & the side <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> A, is hidden inside its <span class="tl">handle</span> marked C as readily as the side B. The two tenons you see at the tip of the <span class="tl">knife</span> are for locking it on one side or the other against a <span class="tl">nail</span> which is at the butt of the aforesaid <span class="tl">handle</span>, so that when one wants to press hard <span class="add">on</span> something in order to cut it, it does not come out from the <span class="tl">handle</span>. You may allow the side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes, <span class="add">but not much</span>, but the side that is notched <span class="del">A</span> and marked A must not cut. <span class="del">It</span> It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And also the notch needs to be as thick as <span class="ms">the back of a <span class="tl">knife</span></span> so that it cannot cause pain. And you will only show the part of the <span class="tl">knife</span> which is not notched, for the side with the notch needs to be <span class="del">mar</span> hidden inside the <span class="tl">handle</span>. And when you want to cut the <span class="bp">nose</span> or a <span class="bp">finger</span>, pretend to sharpen your <span class="tl">knife</span> on the <span class="bp">thigh</span> and, while <span class="del">while</span> doing this, turn the <span class="tl">knife</span> deftly. & the part with the notch, which you will cover <span class="del">l</span> with one <span class="bp">finger</span>, will come into your <span class="bp">hand</span>, and you will place the notch, colored with <span class="m">brazilwood rosette</span> or <span class="m">black cherry juice</span>, upon the <span class="bp">nose</span>.

## To relight an extinguished candle in your hands without blowing

Take a twig of well dried <span class="m">wicker</span> and cut a small piece like a toothpick, and put one of its ends between your index and middle fingers and clasp both your hands together, fingers well joined, and move them deftly around the lit candle as if you wanted to cover it, and your <span class="m">wicker</span> will light. And instantly remove your hands thus clasped, and instantly put out the candle. And then put your hands around it again as if you wanted to cover it, together with your little light from the glowing <span class="m">wicker</span>. By means of the smoke that you are holding in your two palms, the candle will light. And then instantly extinguish your <span class="m">wicker</span> and secretly discard it.
