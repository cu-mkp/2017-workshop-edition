## <span class="pro">Founder</span>

 
The <span class="tl">mould of <span class="m">earth</span></span> is reheated until sometimes it becomes red hot, for otherwise the <span class="m">metal</span> would spatter & would not do anything good. And similarly, the noyau on the inside should be very reheated, & mixed with <span class="m">charcoal powder</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Wax</span> for seal and imprint

 
For the large <span class="m">wax</span> seals, one needs to have <span class="m">tepid water</span> always ready & <span class="del">apre</span> to keep your <span class="m">wax</span> in it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your <span class="bp">hands</span> to render it very even, for otherwise the <span class="m">water</span> that would get in between would prevent it from coming together. Next you will imprint whatever you want and put three or four pieces of <span class="m">paper</span> on, & with a <span class="tl">stick</span> <span class="del">you</span> even & round like a <span class="tl">pestle</span>, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it will attach itself to the <span class="m">paper</span>, which will help you lift it off the <span class="tl">mold</span>. Thus you will imprint better than if you dripped it molten. You can carve the figures & gild them, silver them, & paint them with <span class="m">colors in varnish</span>, & transfer them onto a base of <span class="m">glass</span> painted with <span class="m">colors in turpentine & mastic</span>. And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it with <span class="m">gum ammoniac </span> mixed with <span class="m">vinegar</span>, and you will have good <span class="m">glue</span>.
 
 
  

## Casting in <span class="m">plaster</span>

 
Melt some <span class="m">wax</span>, & with a large <span class="tl">brush</span>, coat the relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint it. And a light crust <span class="del">upon which qu</span> will be formed, upon which you will cast <span class="del">you</span> <span class="m">plaster</span>, to give it body and strength. Next, in the <span class="m">wax</span> cavity, you will also cast your <span class="m">plaster</span> in order to have your relief, & it will come out very easily, thanks to the <span class="m">wax</span>. This is done more often for large pieces in high relief than for others.
