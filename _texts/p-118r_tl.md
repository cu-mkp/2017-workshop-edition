## <span class="al">Snails</span>

 
Those which are found in the <span class="env">sea</span> and similarly those in which certain small crabs dwell are very beautiful for grottoes, if they are stripped of the first crust of their shell with <span class="m">aqua fortis</span>, for they truly appear to be made of <span class="m">mother—of—pearl</span>.
 
 
  

## For removing flaws and flashing from things <span class="tl">molded</span> in a <span class="tl">core mold</span>

 
If your <span class="tl">molds</span> are made of good <span class="m">plaster</span> which withstands fire, they will not crack, especially if they are squeezed well between two tables with <span class="tl">presses</span> or in a <span class="tl">pot</span> filled with <span class="m">ashes</span> or sand, and, therefore, they will not develop flaws. If they they develop some <span class="sup">flaws</span>, you can remove them with a <span class="tl">burin</span> called <span class="tl">chaple</span> which has a tip like a small <span class="tl">chisel</span>.
 
 
  

## For <span class="env">grottoes</span>

<span class="m">Stones made from water</span> called <span class="m">tuf</span>; <span class="m">charcoal</span>; the compound of <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="m">fine latten</span>; <span class="m">paper pestled</span> & mixed with <span class="m">pestled glass</span>; <span class="m">cork</span>; <span class="m">heated parchment</span>; <span class="m">white coral</span> are appropriate for making <span class="env">grottoes</span>. But <span class="m">fantastical pieces of wood</span> which are found in the <span class="env">forests</span> & <span class="m"><span class="pa">mushrooms</span></span> and <span class="m"><span class="pa">potirons</span></span> of trees, once dry, are better than all because they are light. One mixes in small pieces of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> which has a shiny luster. One finely pestles in a different kind of <span class="m">marcasite</span> which one washes to cleanse them of <span class="m">earth</span>, &one dusts the work with it, which is very beautiful. If there is no fountain in the <span class="env">grotto</span>, one glues all <span class="del">al</span> of this with <span class="m">colle forte</span>, <span class="del">which</span> and it is soon done. <span class="add">Take examples of all kinds of <span class="m">mines</span>. The <span class="m">sulfurous marcasites</span> which do not have a grain but are even like <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> are very beautiful.</span>

>   <span class="m">Rosette</span> is found sometimes mixed with certain brittle lumps which are pulverized under the <span class="tl">hammer</span>, which are very beautiful pulverized on <span class="env">grottoes</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Looking—glass tin</span>

 
It whitens and renders firm fine <span class="m">tin</span> if <span class="del">en on</span> one puts <span class="del">in</span> in one ounce of it, that is to say, i ℥ of <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> in one <span class="ms">lb</span> of fine <span class="m">tin</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sal ammoniac</span>

 
<span class="del">It</span><span class="m">Sal ammoniac water</span> is very right for <span class="tl">casting</span> in <span class="m">gold</span> and in <span class="m">silver</span>.
