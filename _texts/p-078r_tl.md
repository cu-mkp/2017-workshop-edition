these <span class="m">drugs</span> melt in a new <span class="tl"><span class="m">earthen</span> pot</span>, & when it is melted, you will pass it in a clean <span class="tl"><span class="m">cloth</span></span> & you will see a beautiful <span class="m">varnish</span>.
 
 
  

## Another <span class="m">varnish</span>

 
Take one <span class="ms">ounce</span> of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span> & heat it over <span class="m">coals</span>, & then take a <span class="ms">half ounce</span> of <span class="m">sang d<span class="del">e</span><span class="add">a</span> Ra<span class="del">ie</span><span class="add">c</span></span> & grind it coarsely, and then put it into the <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> oil</span>, & then mix it with a <span class="tl">stick</span> until you see that it is melted, and then put it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span> vial</span>. And when you want to use it, heat it little by little over the <span class="m">coals</span>. And before laying it, lay a coat of <span class="m">glue very clear</span>, & then lay it with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>.
 
 
  

## For making <span class="m">red varnish</span>

 
Take <span class="m">vermillion</span> & soak it with <span class="m">gum water</span> as well as with other <span class="m">water</span>, and make it like the other <span class="m">varnish</span>, & mix this other <span class="m">water</span> like the other <span class="m">varnish</span>, and then lay it down as before <span class="del">to make three green</span>.
 
 
  

## For making green <span class="m"><span class="del">tr</span>wood</span>

 
Take <span class="m">very strong vinegar</span>, <span class="m">salt</span>, & <span class="m">rainwater</span>, and one needs to put it all together with <span class="m">verdigris</span>, and put it in a new <span class="tl"><span class="m">earthen</span> vessel</span> with your <span class="m">wood</span>, & put it in some very warm <span class="m"><span class="al">horse</span> dung</span> for the space of eight or nine <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">days</span></span>.
