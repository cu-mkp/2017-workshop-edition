The sand <span class="env">near my area</span> is very excellent. But one ought to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been used. For it dries out after having been cast several times & is lean & has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any thickness, it is necessary that your substance of <span class="m">copper</span> be very hot so that it penetrates & runs. Some mix in <span class="m">lead</span> with the fonte, but it is for large works & not for small ones.
 
<span class="m">Sand from <span class="al">oxen</span> feet twice—burned & finely ground</span> melts more neatly with <span class="m">copper</span>, & without a chappe, than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and <span class="del">f</span> with a thickness as delicate as a <span class="tl">knife</span> blade or a <span class="tl">card</span>. And being a hollow on one side, opposite the relief which was on other side.
 
It is necessary that <span class="m">lean sands</span> be more moistened than others, namely with <span class="m">magistra</span> or good <span class="m">pure wine</span> or <span class="m">boiled wine with <span class="pa">elm tree</span> roots</span> & similar things. But <span class="m">very fine sands</span>, like <span class="m">burned linen</span> which is fat & soft on its own, want to be applied dry.
 
All moistened sand wants to be very beaten & stirred in order to be ground finely \& to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself when it is bathed.
 
The <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive</span> oil</span> that some mix in with <span class="m">beaten egg white</span> makes it become porous.
 
<span class="m">Sand of calcined glass</span> withstands several castings, but there are only the first ones. It also becomes porous.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is good to mix it with a little <span class="m">copper</span>, like a <span class="ms">quarter part</span>, with the <span class="m">substance of skillets</span>.
 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> cast well box molds up to 30 or 40 <span class="ms">lb</span>, but not more.

>   It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for releasing. <span class="del">Il</span> because it crumbles. It is good that it be alloyed with some fat thing which has bond such as <span class="m">molded tripoly</span> or <span class="del">ab</span> <span class="m">burned felt</span> or <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> or <span class="m">tripoly</span> & similar things.
