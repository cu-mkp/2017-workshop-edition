## Corroding and dissolving absolutely pure <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Put it regular <span class="m">salt</span> with <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> into a violl. Let it rest for two hours, without heating it. Put <span class="x">in this mixture</span> <span class="m">tenuous gold</span>, and draw it out as if it had been separated from <span class="m">silver</span>.
 
 
  

## For Engraving on <span class="m">iron</span>

 
One ℥ of <span class="m">verdet</span> and ii ℥ of <span class="m">coarse salt</span> & a little <span class="m">sublimate</span>. Or else grind <span class="m">massicot</span> with <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span>, and <span class="del">u</span> cover the blade or <span class="m">quite clean & polished iron</span> with it & leave to dry <span class="env">in the fire</span> or <span class="env">in the sun</span>. And draw on it what you please. Then, to engrave & make the <span class="m">water</span>, take a <span class="ms"><span class="cn">liard</span>’s worth</span> of <span class="m">verdet</span> & put in twice <span class="ms">as much</span> <span class="m">coarse salt</span> & about four <span class="ms">grains</span> of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, & six <span class="ms">grains</span> of <span class="m">sublimate</span>, & the <span class="m">water</span> must not be hot.
 
 
  

## Good mixture to color gold

 
<span class="m">Sulphur</span> & small <span class="m">gravel</span> <span class="ms">as much of one as of the other</span>, & the <span class="ms">third part</span> of <span class="del">soufr</span> <span class="m">salt</span>, & as much <span class="m">terra merita</span> as <span class="m">sulphur</span>.
 
 
  

## How to <span class="m">silver</span> plate <span class="m">copper</span> and <span class="m">latten</span>

 
Mold the <span class="m">silver</span> as the <span class="m">gold</span>, & put it in the oven in order to get a good <span class="m">gilt</span> pot. And do not let it heat, otherwise the <span class="m">silver</span> would tarnish. Once it will be well spread, make it boil in <span class="m">walnut oil</span>, & then heat it a bit, & put it <span class="x">into the <span class="m">water</span> the <span class="pro">silversmiths</span> use to bleach their works</span>.

Soak some <span class="m"><span class="pa">wheat</span> flower</span> in <span class="m">white wine</span>, then besmear & cover the whole <span class="m">cornaline</span> with it. And bring the violet kind to heat again, then put it to temper in <span class="m">white wine</span> for one or two <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span>, then scratch it & leave the part you want to keep on it, then lay on some more on top again.
