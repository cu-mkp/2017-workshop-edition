## Painting <span class="m">metal</span> herbs

 
If you are in a hurry it would be better to mix your color with a not—too—thick <span class="m">gum</span> <span class="del">or</span> because <span class="m">oil</span> takes a <span class="tmp">long time</span> to dry, and it runs if it is transparently layered, as the herbs require. And if you still want it <span class="add">done</span> quickly, mix your color with <span class="m">glair</span> beaten with <span class="m"><span class="pa">fig tree</span> rind</span>, and your work will soon be dry. But layer it transparently.
 
 
  

## Wormwood

 
 The pallid white of this herb is made from <span class="m">green verditer</span>, <span class="m">white lead</span> or <span class="m">ceruse</span>, a bit of <span class="m">massicot</span>, <span class="m">scudegrun</span>, and <span class="m">cendré d'azur</span>. Mix and arrange your color with a branch you have. 
 
 
  

## <span class="al">Viper color</span>

 
 It is the most beautiful <span class="al">snake</span> to mold, because it has very beautiful scales, round and transparent. Its natural color is made from good <span class="m">verdigris</span> well ground, with good <span class="m">vinegar</span>, if it is made of <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>. And in the darkest parts, season this first color with a little <span class="m">sulfur</span>, as you know. And if you need to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub these parts with a rough cloth. Because of its nature, the male ejects a kind of small lump from its backside when pressed, like a half arquebus ball, made in its genitals, and full of highly poisonous prickles.

## Molded roses

 
 Roses are molded with difficulty because of their petals, which are very delicate, weak, and doubled. To avoid this, rub them with <span class="m">wheat oil</span> which is very dessicative, and once dried it stiffens and firms up the leaves to separate them and for them to withstand soaked sand. Do the same thing with <span class="al">flies</span>, pansies, and other delicate things like capers.
