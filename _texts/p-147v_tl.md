## \+Casting with <span class="m">copper</span> alloyed with <span class="m">☾</span>, which is like very low <span class="m">solder</span> and ard<span class="x">...</span>es and <span class="m">old K</span> and some Re out of xii

 
I have cast the cleanest I have ever seen, making very small figures as thin as paper. I have cast extremely hot in the very red mold, and have put into the melted mixture the two compositions which makes <span class="m">silver</span> runny, and have done as if I wanted to throw with <span class="m">pure silver</span>. This <span class="m">league</span> is white when it boils, as with every other alloy which contains even just a small bit of <span class="m">silver</span>. To cast something very delicate, use this.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lute</span>

 
There is none better than the one you have used to mold, that is to say lumps from your molds. But you need to choose some of the better recooked ones.

 
  

## Crucible

 
Beware that it should be three fingers away from the mouth of the bellows and that the aforesaid bellows is positioned underneath the bottom of the crucible, otherwise it will cool it down.

 
  

## <span class="m">Latten</span> casting

 
I have taken the one you find in <span class="m">latten</span> skillets, which have been beaten and forged quite thinly. Having well—heated it, I threw in two or three grains, like beads of <span class="m">sal ammonicac</span>. This will clarify it like a mirror, having turned very white from all the heating, I threw in it some crushed raw and pure <span class="m">calamine</span>. The I casted it in its very red mold. Il cast cleanly and thin like <span class="m">paper</span>, and hollow on the back. Because it has become crusty I cooked it again, which to means to say, I reddened it, and left it to cool, then put it in <span class="m">bleach</span>, made partly with raw <span class="m">tartar</span> and half of common <span class="m">salt</span>. Having boiled it well, I brushed it in clear <span class="m">water</span>, because the first time it was

>  Do not let it cool down when melting. It always makes into filaments, as you would find with melted <span class="m">glass</span>, because of the <span class="m">calamine</span>. Usually, the soft <span class="m">letten</span> of skillets, becomes red from casting, even when it has been in the fire for a longtime, because the <span class="m">calamine</span> evaporates. But the brittle <span class="m">letten</span> of candleholders becomes yellow, as well as the <span class="m">filings</span> made of needles.
