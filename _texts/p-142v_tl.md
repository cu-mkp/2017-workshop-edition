## Molding <span class="al">grasshoppers</span> and things too thin

 
If you have to mold a piece of written—on <span class="m">paper</span> that is too thin, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your <span class="m">paper</span> with melted <span class="m">butter</span>, which is the most appropriate means there is, & for strengthening the wings of either a <span class="al">butterfly</span> or a <span class="al">grasshopper</span>, or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted <span class="m">butter</span> under the wing or in whichever place it will not be seen. For giving thickness to a pansy or other flowers, <span class="m">butter</span> is not good, but rather <span class="m">wheat oil</span>, which is soon dry & holds firm. <span class="m">Wax</span> would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract. But <span class="m">butter</span> is amiable and handleable.

Write therefore with <span class="m">cinnabar</span> mixed with <span class="m">oil</span>, on oiled & stamped (?) <span class="m">paper</span>.

## Molds

 
Make some notches in them <span class="sup">the molds</span> that enter more into the inside of the mold than the outside because in this way, they have more strength. Take care to keep from reheating them suddenly in a burning hot fire, because this will make them break.

> Do not keep them <span class="sup">molds</span> in a humid place, nor an enclosed place if they are not well dry, because they will mold. The same with dried animals.

> It is not at all necessary to reheat the molds two times when the animal can pull away without burning, as do <span class="al">toads</span>, which can very well be molded hollow like all thick animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold once.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lute</span> for <span class="m">luting</span> your molds

 
I have not found a <span class="sup">lute</span> that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the lean <span class="m">earth</span> that <span class="pro">artillery founders</span> and <span class="pro">bell founders</span> use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy. Soak it moderately like a very thick <span class="m">mortar</span>. Mix into it about one half of <span class="m">horse manure</span> and then beat it well. Afterwards mix in one third of <span class="m">cloth waste</span> or <span class="m">cloth shavings</span> and beat it again quite strongly. You can reheat your mold as soon as the <span class="m">lute</span> is ready.
