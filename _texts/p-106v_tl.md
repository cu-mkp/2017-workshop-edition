## Casting in <span class="m">gold</span>

 
To cast in <span class="m">gold</span>, <span class="del">il f</span> <span class="m">crocum ferri</span> is necessary, <span class="add">& more <span class="m">alum de plume</span> than in the following mixture. The <span class="m">alum de plume</span> mixture cannot corrupt anything. The <span class="tl">mold</span> needs to be red & press it promptly with <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> presses</span>.</span>
 
The <span class="m">shell of <span class="al">crabs</span> & <span class="al">crayfish</span></span> are uneasy to burn & there is a proper way of molding them.
 
<span class="al">Rats</span> & <span class="al">birds</span> can be molded, and the feet are uneasy to extract, when burnt, because they are small & delicate. The bodies are extracted more easily from the <span class="tl">mold</span>. The feet are cast in many <span class="del">times</span> pieces.
 
<span class="m">Tiles</span>
 
> *at right middle margin*

> 
>   Those of the <span class="env">houses</span> that are not sandy seem to withstand fire better.
 
<span class="m">Tiles</span> with which one covers <span class="env">houses</span>, the hardest & firmest and recleansed of <span class="m">stones</span> & large <span class="m">gravel</span>, are used to <span class="del">p</span> mix in with the sand <span class="del">et</span> for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat them just until they have been well red for one or two <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span>, & pestle them & pass them finely through a <span class="tl">sieve</span>.
 
The little <span class="al">turtles</span>, having just come out of the egg, are very nice to mold.
 
 <span class="add">If the <span class="m">plaster</span> is mixed with some <span class="m">dust</span> or is not the hard kind, it bursts in the fire & causes flaws.</span>
 
The hardest <span class="m">plaster</span>, as was said, is the best being from <span class="m">stone</span>, therefore take it raw of this kind. Crush it <span class="del">bien</span><span class="add">plus</span> as finely as possible and pass it through the finest <span class="tl">sieve</span> or <span class="tl">sleeve</span> that you can. Being thusly <span class="del">p</span><span class="add">b</span> fine, put it, <span class="add">in a <span class="ms">good amount</span></span>, in a <span class="tl">cauldron</span> or <span class="tl">skillet</span> over an open flame, & as it begins to heat up, stir it continuously, and heavy & lumpy as it is, it will become so light & so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance to <span class="del">handling</span><span class="add">stirring</span>, as if it was <span class="m">water</span>. Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy & dense, and that is the sign it is cooked. <span class="add">But do not reheat it until your <span class="m">brick</span> and <span class="m">alum de plume</span> are reheated & your <span class="m">clay</span> circles are done. For it needs to be the last one reheated & when all the rest is ready, for the less <span class="m">plaster</span>#</span>
 
> *at left bottom margin*

> 
>   # remains reheated, & <span class="del">plus</span> the quickest it is put to work, that is the best, for it sets more quickly. One ought not reheat it until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put it, as finely ground raw powder, in a <span class="tl">cauldron</span> on <span class="del">ash</span> a clear flame & do not make it neither too strong nor too violent. Always stir with a long <span class="tl">stick</span>, to avoid the vapor, turning it around the <span class="tl">cauldron</span> & in the middle, in a figure 8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy <span class="del">difficult</span> to stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to throw off some bubbles at the edge of the <span class="tl">cauldron</span>. And finally it will become like liquid & mealy & like bran & boiling in the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it has once again become heavy

<span class="m">Alum de plume</span> is the one that gives good binding to sand.
 
<span class="m">Crocum ferri</span> is appropriate for <span class="m">gold</span>. It is it, once mixed within the sand, that receives it & holds it within its warmth.

 When you have it as a <span class="m">stone</span>, choose the hardest bits and those which do not easily crumble away with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">nail</span></span>, and clean it well from powder & filth before you pestle it.

But when fresh, it is excellent for exquisite work.
