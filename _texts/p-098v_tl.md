## Small dogs

 
Small barbet dogs are recognizable thanks to their muzzle which is larger than that of other dogs.
 
 
  

## Salted <span class="m">artichokes</span>

 
One should put them fill and not too ripe in a small barrel full of <span class="m">brine</span>. Then can be served all year long, with salads, <span class="m">oil</span> and <span class="m">vinegar</span>, raw, as prepared in this way they take long to cook. Make sure to try your <span class="m">brine</span> with an <span class="m">egg</span>: if it is good, the <span class="m">egg</span> will float in it. If it does not float, it means <span class="x">the <span class="m">brine</span></span> is not strong enough and would not conserve the <span class="m">fruits</span>.
 
 
  

## Trees

 
Those which carry <span class="m">fruits</span> age early and do not last long.
 
 
  

## Birds

 
Those who have been fed at the spit do not sing among or the company of other birds, they do only when they have their own cage. To teach them to sing well, they have to be taken from their nest as young as possible, and be covered with a <span class="m">duvet</span> or <span class="m">rabbit skin</span>. That way, having not seen their father and known their voice, they learn better to sing the way they are taught to.
 
 
  

## Fonte

 
The <span class="m">potée</span> is made of <span class="m">burnt earth</span> which was used in the fonte, this is <span class="m">earth bourre bolvene</span> in which one has melted it. One grinds it on a big <span class="tl"><span class="m">stone</span></span>, & with this one one makes the <span class="del">chappe of</span> first coat of the chappe of bells, where there are letters & works, & <span class="del">le</span> only needs to be reheated in the flame of a <span class="m">straw</span>, and mold very neatly.
 
The <span class="m">earth</span> which molds in noyau is subject to making it porous, if you do not rub well with a <span class="tl">brush</span> or your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span> on the molded piece, which should be well <span class="m">oiled</span>. And do it coat by coat, & not all at once.
