## Casting in <span class="tl">box molds</span>

 
The same sand that was used in the reheated noyaulx, composed of <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="m">brick</span> and <span class="m">alum de plume</span> as is said, is excellent for casting in <span class="tl">box molds</span>, and I have experienced it thus: I crushed the pieces which had come out of <span class="tl">core molds</span> in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>, dragging the <span class="tl">pestle</span>, because this sand is very doulx. I did not pass it through the <span class="tl">sieve</span>, because the <span class="m">alum de plume</span> mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I ground finely upon <span class="tl">marble</span> what seemed to me too coarse. And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <span class="m">sal ammoniac water</span>, made of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, as much as the size of two <span class="ms"><span class="pa">walnuts</span></span>, in a bottle of <span class="m">common water</span> the same size as a <span class="tl">bottle</span> in which one boils <span class="m">tisane</span>, or in a good <span class="tl">pot</span> of <span class="m">water</span> so that you find the <span class="m">water</span> fairly salty. I mixed throughout half a <span class="ms">glass</span> of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, two <span class="tl">silver spoonfuls</span> of <span class="m">spirits</span>. Having thus moistened the sand in such a way that it took hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my medal with <span class="m">pulverized charcoal</span> with a <span class="tl">file</span> to rid it of <span class="m">oil</span>, and all other <span class="m">grease</span>. It is necessary to avoid them, for they would hinder good stripping. I blew on my medal & molded it, and the female part of the <span class="tl">box mold</span> once filled, I marked & made a line on the reverse & edge of the medal, & on the nearby sand as well. In order that the second <span class="tl">box mold</span> take the imprint thereupon to indicate the place for making the cast, <span class="del">once filled</span><span class="del">the female part of the box mold once filled</span> I uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with <span class="m">pulverized charcoal</span>, and then filled the male part with sand. <span class="del">Once mad</span> I separated the <span class="tl">box mold</span> and did not hit the corners of the medal to make it strip, because that knocks the sand and makes it crumble. Rather I struck the back of the <span class="tl">box mold</span>, retaining the obverse of the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not stripped thus, I would have waited to remove it until the <span class="tl">box mold</span> had been dried out over fire. I lit a row of <span class="m">charcoals</span> between two little <span class="tl">trivets</span> of <span class="m">iron</span> in the form that you see, and put the back & reverse of <span class="tl">box molds</span> thereupon, & the imprint on top,

 because in this way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should crack from being too moistened, it is on the back that they take the harshest fire, & the imprint remains safe & whole.

>  Excellent sand
 
Take a little of the same sand, the finest that you can, for covering the medal.

>   Note that I filled the <span class="tl">box mold</span> before pressing it, and did not hit it, but rather pressed it with the strength of my <span class="bp">hands</span> alone, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure your <span class="tl">box mold</span> that it does not shift at all, & if you put some moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.
