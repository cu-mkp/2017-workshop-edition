<span class="tl">Molds</span> can only be used once for fine things, like <span class="pa">wormwood</span> & others, one needs to break them, but before one needs to dip them well into <span class="m">water</span> in which the twice reheated things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be able <span class="del">f</span> to release your work without danger of spoiling it.
 
<span class="m">Good alum de plume</span> is white and as lustrous as <span class="m">white <span class="del">c</span> silk</span>. It is in pieces long as a <span class="ms"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>, & is very breakable & wooly as <span class="m">down</span>. The one made of <span class="m">stone</span> is harder & not so good. <span class="del">Il</span> The best of the above mentioned quality is brought in <span class="pl">France</span> near <span class="pl">Rouan</span>. The <span class="m">alum de plume</span> for our sand is pestled in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>, and is ground further on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, especially since one cannot think of passing it finely through the <span class="tl">sieve</span>, for it is so fat & wooly, that it would not pass through it. It is this, with its small soft <span class="del">qui</span> & thin filaments, which gives binding to the sand, in a much more excellent way than <span class="m">tondure</span> in the <span class="m">founder’s earth of the <span class="pro">founders of great works</span></span>, because this <span class="m">tondure</span> & <span class="m">cloth waste</span> burns and <span class="m">alum de plume</span> resists the fire.
 
To enclose the <span class="tl">molds</span>, when you <span class="del">em</span> throw onto the things to mold your liquid sand, make <span class="del">your</span> a circle & surround with well beaten <span class="m">fat earth</span>.
 
Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria,<br/> v<span class="exp">idelicet</span> res exprimenda formis, sive <span class="m">herba</span> sit sive <span class="m">animal</span><br/> ut <span class="m">lucerta</span>, <span class="del">in</span> <span class="del">af</span> <span class="del">inting</span> inmergatur primum in <span class="m">vini spiritum</span><br/> aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur<br/> sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut<br/> assolet<span class="sup">)</span>.
 
When you want to mold hollow, it is necessary that the noyau be of the same substance. And if the <span class="al">snake</span> or the animal is curved or folded, one ought to make the noyau of several pieces.
 
Try <span class="sup">to see</span> if <span class="m">distilled vinegar</span> is appropriate for eating away & dissolving what will be in the animal molded hollow.

>   If you know that your <span class="m">plaster</span> is not strong enough to withstand the fire without breaking, do not be so scrupulous an observer of the mixture put here that sometimes you <span class="del">mecties</span> would not diminish the quantity of <span class="m">alum de plume</span> <span class="del">l</span><span class="add">d</span> a little bit, for it softens the <span class="tl">molds</span> with its sweetness. Once reheated do not pulverise it, on this occasion, as fine as said, but leave it as the <span class="pro">apothecaries</span> have ground it, for it does not hinder the neatness of the cast & gives more binding. When the <span class="del">sand</span> mold, <span class="del">estant</span> having set, retains the color <span class="m">brick</span>, and is reddish, it is firmer.
