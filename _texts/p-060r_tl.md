and to prevent it from breaking, mix in a little <span class="m">oil</span> & melt them together & fill the cracks & make them even and paint on them. And the <span class="m">oil</span> mixed with <span class="m">wax</span> will <span class="del">q</span> help colors to hold since they are also distempered with <span class="m">oil</span>.

 
  

## First whitening of a panel

 
One layers two or three times with <span class="m">chalk</span> tempered with <span class="m">colle <span class="add">de destrempe</span></span> on the panel, not with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> but with a <span class="tl">broisse</span> in such a way as if you wanted to pounce, & leave to dry. And reiterate up to two or three times, then even the last ground layer out well with a <span class="tl">knife</span>, <span class="add">then give coat of <span class="m">glue</span>on top</span>, upon which you will next be able to make your impression and then paint. But make sure that your first white is not too thick for it would break easily. <span class="pl">Flemish</span> <span class="pro">painters</span> have such panels made by the dozen.

 
  

## Neat work

 
When you are working, make sure not to stir up dust, & when you leave your work, cover it so that the said dust will not fall upon it. Also layer your colors as thinly as you can, for if they are thick you will be not be able to soften them thoroughly.

>   Also do not layer color on color if they are not similar, such as white on black, but rather flesh color on flesh color, & thus with the others. And leave blank the space for shadow or a different color. <span class="del">Ains</span> in this way, layering each kind of color only on the impression, they will not die & you will work neatly.

 
  

## <span class="m">Oil</span>

 
<span class="m"><span class="pa">Walnut</span> oil</span> extracted like<span class="m">peeled <span class="pa">almonds</span></span> is very white. This one of <span class="m">Palma christi</span>. And when the <span class="m">oil</span> has had a little body, the colors soften. For if the <span class="m">oil</span> is too clear, the colors run & do not bind, even those that do not have body. <span class="m">Fatty oil</span> that is not easily imbibed is appropriate for <span class="m">varnish</span>. The <span class="m">oil</span> is desiccative enough when it dries out as quickly as <span class="m">common varnish</span>. <span class="m">Oils</span> do not dry as quickly in cold countries as in hot countries. <span class="m">Oil</span> <span class="env">exposed to the sun</span> is clarified well. But it fattens. If you put in <span class="m">ceruse</span> or <span class="m">lead filings</span> or <span class="m">lead white</span> or <span class="m">calcined pulverized <span class="del">p</span>glass</span>. To avoid this, put the <span class="tl">vial</span> in <span class="m">clear water</span>.
 
Colors in <span class="m">oil</span>, once dry, sometimes do not easily receive the second colors, to prevent this, breathe on them & the color will take.
