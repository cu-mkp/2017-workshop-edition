## Casting in <span class="m">silver</span>

 
You need to place the animals as said, and make up the same sand out of <span class="ms">four parts</span> <span class="m">plaster</span>, <span class="ms">two parts</span> refired<span class="m">brick</span>, and <span class="ms">one part</span> annealed <span class="m">stone alum</span>. Mix it well, and once it is ready and you wish to mold, take <span class="ms">three parts</span> of the aforementioned sand in the earthenware <span class="tl">dish</span> from which the peasants eat their soup. Add pure annealed <span class="m">stone alum</span> that has been pulverized in the <span class="m">mortar</span>, as much as you can grab with your <span class="ms">four <span class="bp">finger</span>s and <span class="bp">thumb</span></span>, or a <span class="ms">small double handful</span>. Then, mix well and mix in a little of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> and the remainder with <span class="m">common water</span>\+

 And stir it with your <span class="tl">spatula</span> so that it all becomes like a thick sauce or clear <span class="m">mustard</span>. And having rubbed spirits on the animal with the <span class="tl">brush</span>, cast and blow, and beat the table to shake the <span class="tl">mold</span> and do as with the others. Do not forget to put in <span class="m">crocum</span>, because it prevents <span class="tl">molds</span> from cracking, and it is appropriate for all <span class="m">metals</span>.

## <span class="m">Silver</span> <span class="x">used</span> to cast

 
It is not pure but alloyed <span class="m">silver</span>, and it does not become perfectly white on the fire because they <span class="x"><span class="pro">goldsmiths</span></span> whiten it after the melting to clean up the welding marks that occur when an animal needs to be attached to another or when it needs repairing. <span class="x">The process</span> is similar with teston <span class="m">silver</span> and all alloyed <span class="m">silver</span> as long as it is soft and good.
 
Before starting to cast in <span class="m">silver</span>, in order to coat all round and strengthen your <span class="tl">mold</span>s, you should use <span class="m">earth</span> that can withstand fire, such as this sandy <span class="m">earth</span> mixed with <span class="m">cloth waste</span> which <span class="pro">founders</span> use to cast their canons, or any good <span class="m">lute</span> that can withstand fire. They need to all be red and to be tied with <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wire</span>.
 
Rather than anneal the <span class="tl">mold</span>s, have the mixture necessary so that the <span class="m">silver</span> runs.
 
If <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> knew the material to make <span class="m">silver</span> run in their work, they would buy it in quantity. Some buy it five sols for a denier.

>   Before luting and strengthening the <span class="tl">mold</span>s for <span class="m">gold</span> and <span class="m">silver</span> with the said <span class="m">earth</span>, the cast and the vents must be made and the <span class="tl">mold</span>s must have been annealed and made quite red to burn the animals, flowers and herbs that are inside. The ashes in the <span class="tl">mold</span>s should be cleaned thoroughly. Once the <span class="tl">mold</span>s are quite clean and ready, lute them and bind them with <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> wire</span>. Anneal them straight away until they are quite red.
