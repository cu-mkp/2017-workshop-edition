## Stamped medals made from <span class="m">wax</span>

 
You can mold your relief with <span class="m">wax</span> mixed with a bit of <span class="m">resin</span> to make it harder and firmer, whatever relief that you wish, either an animal or a medal. And then, fashion a hollow out of this relief in <span class="m">brass</span> or <span class="m">copper</span>. Or mold your <span class="x"><span class="m">wax</span></span> in relief and strike it in a sheet of <span class="m">tin</span>. And fill <span class="x">your final product</span> with <span class="m">lead</span>, and heat it. Try <span class="x">to use</span> blades of <span class="m">stone leaf</span> to make the hollow for lizards &
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Sand</span> for casting <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Take <span class="m">common sand</span> made of <span class="m">alum, plaster</span> and <span class="m">brick</span>, according to the composition above—mentioned. Add to it some more <span class="m">feather alum</span>. And add as well something a third part of <span class="m">crocum ferri</span>. However whatever quantity is never harmful, because <span class="x"><span class="m">crocum ferri</span></span> is the one that makes <span class="m">gold</span> shiny and makes it come out of its cast easily. But it is best if your <span class="m">crocum</span> has previously been left for three days and three nights in the furnace of <span class="pro">glassworkers</span>, in a flat box, where it is not very thick so that it will reheat better.

Before the invention of <span class="m">crocum</span>, one cast flowers in <span class="m">silver</span>, but not in gold. This has only been known in Germany for forty years.

>   <span class="m">Sublimate</span> is often used by <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> for <span class="m">gold</span>. Some people add <span class="m">sulphur</span>, but they are all wrong, because <span class="m">sulphur</span> makes things sour, even if it heats <span class="x">well.</span>, And <span class="m">sublimate</span> gets agitated,boils and bubbles. It is very good to clean <span class="m">gold</span> because its exaltation draws <span class="x">the bad stuff</span> out that disappears in the smoke. But to heat up <span class="m">gold</span>, and to keep the heat, there is only the color of <span class="m">verdigris</span>, <span class="m">salt of ammoniacum</span>, <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, and <span class="m">borax</span>. This makes it runny and you will be able to throw in a branch from the Santoinge.
 
 
  

## Nightingale

 
It is necessary for the cage, made like those for larks found in barns and lined with green fabric, to be made with something that slides out from underneath, so that you can refresh the dirt everyday, because the nightingale loves it, and mix in some ants. You can carry an ant—hill with its dirt in a barred full of earth, and keep them there and they will lay their eggs and in this way, you can always have access to them when you need them, should you enjoy feeding nightingales. When you caught it, it was fat and full. And to keep it in such good shape, on the first day, you must take it in you hand and open its beak and place in it, using a sharp twig, some mutton heart or other delicate flesh, chopped up not too finely, so that the belly does something, and make sure that it does not get smaller or thinner, until it has gotten used to it. And feed it in this way three or four times a day, and also give it something to drink. The next morning, you will give him in his cage some well—minced flesh mixed with the yolk of a hard—boiled egg, and change this mixture two or three times a day, because it will not eat it if it is hard and not fresh. And If it goes half a day without eating, you must feed it as before and do so until
