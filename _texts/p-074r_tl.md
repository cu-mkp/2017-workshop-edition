## For <span class="m">bronzing</span> white

 
Take <span class="m">looking—glass tin</span> & put it to soak in <span class="m">gum water</span> & pound it in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>. And next, you will put it on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>.
 
 
  

## To make <span class="m">vermillion</span>

 
Take two pounds of <span class="m">sulphur</span>, and melt it, and add two pounds of <span class="add"><span class="m">mercury</span></span> to it. And if this material ignites, cover it quite neatly, so that the air does not pass into the pot, then put everything for some time after into a <span class="m">leaded</span> pot, into the fire. In the space of twenty—four hours, you will have good <span class="m">vermillon</span>. 
 
 
  

## For making <span class="m">varnish</span>

 
Take one <span class="ms">pound</span> of <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span>, and then you will put it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">earthen</span> pot</span>, mixed with a <span class="m">crust of bread</span> and three <span class="m"><span class="pa">onions</span></span>, and put it on top of a <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire, and you will cook it on a little fire, so that it boil for the space of five <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span>. You will take <span class="ms">half an ounce</span> of <span class="m">colle farine</span>, & you will make it boil just as before and stir with a <span class="tl">spoon</span>. And then after, you will put in two <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">well—pounded sandarac</span> & will do as above. And then after, you will take <span class="m"><span class="m">mastic</span> & <span class="m">arrab<span class="del">e</span><span class="add">i</span>c</span>, two <span class="ms">ounces</span> each, which will both be well ground</span>, and you will put everything together, & will make it boil while stirring continuously, for the space of five <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span>. And then you will put <span class="m"><span class="del">d’araucq</span> <span class="add">rock</span> alum</span>, two <span class="ms">ounces</span>, & then you will make it boil. And if you add two <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="del">l’arable</span><span class="add"><span class="m">arabic</span></span> to it, if you see that they are not cooked enough, have it cook more on a low
