## Soldering a vise

 
It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high for use in making a long piece, and that they join well to clamp a thin object. In order to solder the nut, after you have made the bolt, you will make a long <span class="m">iron</span> strip of the right thickness to fit into the notch of the bolt when red hot, and you will bend it all around <span class="x">the bolt</span> by striking it with a hammer. Once it is well wrapped around, you will insert the bolt around which the nut is wrapped.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Copper</span>

 
If, in the fire &melting, it touches the <span class="m">iron</span>, this <span class="m">iron</span> will be afterwards so brittle that it will be able to be forged.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lead</span> casting

 
One mixes it, according to some, with <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">tin</span> & <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">lead</span> and, to <span class="add">heat</span> <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> it, one mixes in a little <span class="m">sublimate</span>. It casts well in small sizes in a <span class="tl"><span class="m"><span class="al">cuttlefish</span> bone</span></span>, provided it is good.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Paper</span> molding

 
Boil <span class="add">over hot <span class="m">ashes</span></span> some <span class="m">cotton</span> in <span class="m">aqua fortis</span> mixed with <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, like <span class="m">aqua regia</span>, and the <span class="m">cotton</span> will become very fine, like powder. Mix it next it with <span class="m">gummed water</span> & you will cast very delicately.
 
 
  

## Almond trees, apricot trees

 
They grow quite straight if they are grafted. And every kind of tree <span class="x">whose fruit has</span> pits, such as nectarines, peaches, clingstone—peaches, apricots etc., comes best by shield budding on an almond tree by.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Lead</span> and <span class="m">copper</span> casting

 
<span class="m">Lead</span> & <span class="m">tin</span> come out well in <span class="m">white chalk</span> but the softer it is the better. The one from <span class="pl">Champaigne</span> reaches the price that is fixed in <span class="pl">Lyon</span>. <span class="m">Burnt & calcined <span class="al">horse</span> bones</span> mold very neatly.

>   I believe that the <span class="m">marrow from the horns of <span class="al">oxen</span></span> or <span class="m"><span class="al">sheep</span></span>, that is to say, the <span class="m">spongy bone</span> from the inside, molds very neatly and is better than <span class="m">bone</span>.
 
> *at bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   Note that all <span class="m">brittle metal comes out better than fat</span> ones. Also, <span class="m">lean sand</span> receives it better & absorbs it rather than the <span class="m">dense one</span>.
