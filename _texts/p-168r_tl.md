rod that we put into the touch—hole, and then, with a rope wrapped around the end of a baston, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take cover. The small mortars of 16 or 17 lb. are attached promptly with a short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of 27 lb., but then we only put three lb. of powder. The door really needs to be strong so as not to be blown off for seventeenth lb. mortars. Some people use little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others load two canons of guns and, with a gimlet and a string, tie them with the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.
 
A is a small rod, hooked like the hinge of a door and made as a biron on one end in order to quickly attach a small mortar with handles of fifteen or xvii lb. for a common door or window.
 
B is a small mortar with handles.
 
C is a common mortar of 27 or 30 lb. pierced at the bottom, where a large <span class="m">iron</span> rod passes, button—like on one end made like a biron on the tip so as to quickly hang the mortar against a door that will not be covered with <span class="m">iron</span> plates.
 
D These are slabs of <span class="m">wax</span>, <span class="m">cork</span> and <span class="m">wood</span> for loading the mortar and well packing the powder.
 
E <span class="m">iron</span> fork made in the form of pincers as tall as a man, used to quickly set the mortar without a rod. It must be of soft <span class="m">iron</span> so that the sides fold easily, if needed, and to accommodate the height or width of the door.
 
F is another <span class="m">iron</span> fork of the same height that supports the fork made as pincers and also sustains the mortar, and with its low claw prevents the pincers from recoiling.
