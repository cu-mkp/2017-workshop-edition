## Loading an arquebus

 
You must have different charges depending to the range that you want your arquebus to have, all of which have a screw on the end that fits in the nut of the the said arquebus' ramrod. So when you put the powder in the charge, which is in the nut, hold the ramrod upright. And raising your arquebus up, insert the said ramrod until the charge is in the bottom of the arquebus, then straighten the arquebus, the mouth of the barrel up, and remove the ramrod. That way, your powder will now be entirely in the breech without any grain or dust that lines the sides of the arquebus, which always has some grime in the chamber. That way it will not recoil, and you will shoot more true.

## How to adjust a bent gun barrel

 
Take off the breech and put it <span class="x">the barrel</span> on a wellâ€”leveled table set perpendicular to the floor, and insert a very smooth string without knots, on each end of which there is a plumb hanging from each side. Then look in the barrel along the string, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the place where it does not touch and hit it with a hammer on the exterior of this this side in the same place, and this will make it straight. Do this all around it.
