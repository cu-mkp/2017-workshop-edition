## Cross of the <span class="pro">commanders of <span class="pl">Malta</span></span>

 
This beautiful <span class="m">rouge clair</span> which makes the field of the white <span class="m">enamel</span> cross is <span class="del">blood</span> of fine tear of <span class="m"><span class="al">dragon</span>'s blood</span> tempered with <span class="m">eau de vie</span> or else <span class="m"><span class="pl">Indian</span> laque plate</span>, which in my opinion is made in <span class="pl">Flanders</span>, tempered with <span class="m">clear turpentine</span> & tear of <span class="m">mastic</span> & laid down on a <span class="m">silver</span> leaf, not the kind which the <span class="pro">painters</span> use, but a thicker kind, which is burnished by <span class="pro">those who make foil backings for gemstones</span> <span class="del">Av</span> or by <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span>, & that gives it this beautiful brilliance.

 
  

## <span class="m">Latten</span> and <span class="m">calamine</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span> do not melt <span class="m">latten</span> in a <span class="tl"><span class="del">air</span><span class="add">bellow</span> furnace</span> but in <span class="tl">crucibles</span>, for in a <span class="tl"><span class="add">bellow</span> furnace</span> & amid the <span class="m">charcoals</span>, the <span class="m">calamine</span> would disappear. <span class="del">A</span>

 
  

## <span class="m">Metal</span>

 
<span class="m">Tin</span> should be pure for if there is any <span class="m">lead</span>, it will go up in smoke while melting. Mixed <span class="m">tin</span> holds in the fire for a long time but the <span class="tl"><span class="m">cendrée</span></span> separates it.

 
  

## <span class="m">Aquafortis</span>

 
If your <span class="tl">retort</span> is well <span class="tl"><span class="m">luted</span></span> one ought not to surround it with <span class="tl"><span class="m">ashes</span></span>, which would only get in the way of chasing the <span class="m">spirits</span> properly. But when, towards the end, you give it violent fire, surround it with coals lit elsewhere beforehand, as those in the <span class="tl">furnace</span> should be, so they do not crackle & do not make smoke. Put the said lit coals around the body of the <span class="tl">retort</span>, & not close to the neck, which does not need to be heated as vigorously. The <span class="tl">top grate</span>, where you place your <span class="tl">retort</span>, is sufficiently far from the <span class="tl">bottom grate</span> where the charcoal is placed, one <span class="ms">dour</span> or <span class="ms">half a foot</span>, for by doing this you will not waste as much of it.
