*[continued]*
  
Their <span class="tl">hammers</span> must be quite even & polished, and if in some unfortunate case the rust, <span class="del">the</span> or some other use, has damaged them, they first polish them with <span class="m">emery stone powder</span>, then they finish burnishing & smoothing with the <span class="m">putty</span>. Otherwise they would not strike neatly. It is also necessary that the face of the <span class="tl">anvils</span> be the same.
 
 
  

## A new vine

 
When <span class="x">the vine</span> has taken root well, if you want it to grow many cordons, having dug furrows <span class="x">next to it</span>, put two handfuls of <span class="m">pigeon guano</span> next to each rootstock.
 
 
  

## Colored water

 
Distilled <span class="m">urine</span>, <span class="m">distilled vinegar</span> and <span class="m">eau—de—vie</span> take on a blue and green color from powdered and finely ground <span class="m">burnt bronze</span>. And the residue from this tincture will be <span class="m">red copper</span> if you distill the things indicated with a filter.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span> resistant to <span class="m">water</span>

 
<span class="m"><span class="pl">Flanders</span> varnish</span>, made with <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m">oil</span> from this or from <span class="m">mastic</span>, can come off and does not hold up <span class="env">in the rain</span>. But that made with <span class="m">huile de noix blanche</span>, as you have done, holds <span class="env">in the rain</span> and is very clear & beautiful & dries soon. This is why one uses this one for painted banners & signs that one carries <span class="env">in the rain</span>.
 
 
  

## Fruit made from <span class="m">sugar</span>

 
One does not paint them with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> like other <span class="del">s</span> things with moistened color, because the <span class="m">sugar</span> would melt. But one rubs them with color with the <span class="tl"><span class="bp">finger</span></span>.
