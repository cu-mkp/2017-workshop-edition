## <span class="m">Black varnish</span>

 
It is said, at the beginning of the book where you can see it, that it is made with <span class="m">galipot</span>. 
 
 
  

## Gilding

 
One prepares the guards thoroughly with a soft, very <span class="tl">soft file</span> such that there is nothing black left on any of the guards, and next heat them, & pass them as said. But to gild & gild with <span class="m">silver</span>, they ought not to pass, except maybe a little towards blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a wood block & with some <span class="tl">tweezers</span> one layers the <span class="m">gold</span> & one makes it sit with <span class="m">bloodstone</span>,which is quite clean & rubbed with <span class="m">pottée</span>. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them, then one layers the <span class="m">gold</span> as above. And first one gives <span class="del">de</span> two layers, until the entire guard is well—adorned. And next one reheats as at the beginning, & one gives the third covering of <span class="m">gold</span>. Then one burnishes very thoroughly and with great force with a large <span class="m">bloodstone</span>. <span class="del">And</span> But note that <span class="add">to</span> burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to know this, <span class="sn">one smells it & brings it close to the <span class="bp">nose</span></span>. For one ought not to touch with the <span class="bp">fingers</span>, but one <span class="del">grasps</span> picks it up from on top of the warm <span class="m">ashes</span> with a small <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> rod</span>, which has been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is entirely well—polished, one rubs it very well with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">white linen</span></span>, and the <span class="m">gold</span> needs to be thicker & stronger than for <span class="pro">painters</span>. A <span class="ms">quarter</span> is worth fifty or LX <span class="cn">s<span class="exp">ols</span></span>.
 
 
  

## Gilding with <span class="m">silver</span>

 
One needs to prepare the guards & whiten them with a <span class="del">lince </span> <span class="tl">file</span>, a little coarser <span class="del">for</span> than for <span class="m">gold</span>. And one makes them pass to grey, as for gilding. And when they are warm, one needs to double the <span class="m">leaf of silver</span>, then divide it with a <span class="tl">knife</span>, next cover the guard with it, with <span class="del">un petit</span> <span class="tl">tweezers</span> & a small <span class="tl">burnisher</span>. And then reheat & apply them, until they are all gilded in <span class="m">silver</span>. Next one needs to cover them for the third time, with the <span class="m">leaf</span> doubled as has been said, then burnish them very strongly & with good strength, not with the <span class="m">bloodstone</span>, but with a strong <span class="tl">burnisher</span>, just as the <span class="tl">burnisher</span> ought not to burnish <span class="m">gold</span>.
