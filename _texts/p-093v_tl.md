## Faces in <span class="m">distemper</span>

 
Because colors in <span class="m">distemper</span> dry quickly & one would not have leisure to perfect the shadows & touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face which is on <span class="m">canvas</span> with a wet <span class="tl">sponge</span>. Then, with a small <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, one makes the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color, which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent areas. And with another <span class="tl">pinceau</span> one does the shadows <span class="add">again</span> by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone because they are made of <span class="m">bistre</span>, which stains the <span class="m">canvas</span> like <span class="m">rust</span>. The said <span class="m">bistre</span> is good <span class="del">with</span> for making shadows in <span class="m">distemper</span> <span class="del">mix</span>, for in <span class="m">oil</span> it has no body & would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in the said <span class="m">bistre</span>, for shadow, <span class="m">ocre de ru</span> & a little <span class="m">sap green</span>. The best <span class="m">bistre</span> is the greasy & shiny kind from the <span class="env">fireplaces of large kitchens</span>. It is difficult to grind & screeches on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Azure</span>

 
<span class="m">Azur d’esmail</span> always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the laveures makes it die. One needs to coat it two times, & the first very thick, moving the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> by laying it first lengthwise then across.  It is better used on <span class="m">canvas</span>, where it is imbibed immediately, than on <span class="m">wood</span>. <span class="m">Varnish</span> returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it, <span class="pro">painters</span> bring their <span class="tl">palette</span> to the <span class="pro">grocers</span>, & distemper & alloy it with a little white ground in <span class="m">oil</span>, for in this way, the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most delicate is the best for working. It is thinned <span class="del">working</span> by washing it.
 
 
  

## Violet and <span class="m">lake</span>

 
It is made of <span class="m">azure</span> & <span class="m">lake</span> which is also assayed on the <span class="tl">palette</span> with white. It is deemed beautiful that which which, on a <span class="m">polished knife</span> or on <span class="tl"><span class="m">glass</span></span> gives a clear <span class="del">red</span> color of red rose, tending a little towards violet. The kind which is <span class="del">blac</span> dark red is not as pleasant.
