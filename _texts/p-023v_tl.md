<span class="m">powder</span>. When the sausage is filled, dip it gently in two <span class="ms">parts</span> <span class="m">vinegar</span> and one of <span class="m">spirits</span>, to moisten the <span class="m">canvas</span> but not the <span class="m">powder</span>. Next, leave the aforesaid <span class="m">canvas</span> to dry completely, and then you need to attach to the sausage a long <span class="m">string</span> or <span class="m">cord</span> <span class="ms">twice as long as the sausage</span>, but you must not tie it to the sausage but make it touch the two ends and sew it to the sausage in a few places in the middle. Next you need to smear all of the sausage with very good <span class="m">turpentine</span>, and at one end, where you will want to join to the <span class="m">mortar</span>'s fuse for firing, you can sew or tightly attach with a selvage of <span class="m">canvas</span> as large as one <span class="ms">empan</span> which should also be well soaked in <span class="m">turpentine</span>, and this selvage should be cut in the middle so that it can be fastened and wrapped around the <span class="m">mortar</span>, and you must attach it so that the tip of the sausage that is open will be joined to the fuse of the <span class="m">mortar</span>. Then you need to place a lot of tightly—packed <span class="m">powder</span> onto the fuse of the <span class="m">mortar</span>. And next, the person outside of the ditch should draw the small <span class="m">string</span> and <span class="m">cord</span> that is joined to the sausage so that it is extended mid—way, but not so much that it is detached. And if there is <span class="m">water</span> in the ditch, it will be necessary to support the sausage with a fork. Then, having placed himself and others in safety, the person who holds the tip of the sausage will be able to fire.
 
 
  
<span class="m">Mortars</span> that one wants to fix on doors or <span class="m">iron</span> gates are sufficient if they weigh 40 or 50 <span class="ms">lb</span>. For the rest, for its charge, cannonball, and process, you need to do all just as was already said before concerning the one of 3 <span class="ms">quintals</span>. One man can carry it.
 
 
  
The cannonball needs to be be round on one side and flat on the other like a <span class="ms">half</span> of a cut cannonball. The cross also needs to stick to the ball — the latter melting if it is made with <span class="m">metal</span> — and is enveloped in the middle of the cross.
