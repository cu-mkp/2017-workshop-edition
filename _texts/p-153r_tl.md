## Moulding the hollow part of a mold for seals or other things

 
Firstly fashion your figure in <span class="m">wax</span> on an even slab of <span class="m">glass</span> or <span class="m">slate</span>. After, mold it with our aforesaid sand, having beforehand lightly smeared with <span class="m">oil</span> as you know, and having rubbed it with <span class="m">spirits</span>, while tempering your sand with <span class="m">hot water</span>. Having made the hollow part, cast it in <span class="m">lead</span>, using the same alloy as you do for other figures that come out very neatly. However, if it does not release cleanly, repair it. And then mold with <span class="m">wax</span> on the <span class="m">lead</span> relief & you will have a very neat cavity in the <span class="m">wax</span> that comes out very neat in <span class="m">lead</span>. After, in your <span class="m">wax</span> hollow part, throw in your tempered sand which will give you a relief, upon which you will cast your hollow part with <span class="m">silver</span>, or any other metal used for seals. But note that you must not make your hollow part with melted <span class="m">wax</span>, but only with <span class="m">wax</span> warmed in hot <span class="m">water</span>, or even better in hot <span class="m">urine</span>. Or else, if you have a relief in <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span>, or any other very neat and flawless metal, mold your <span class="m">wax</span> hollow part directly upon it, and throw your sand in it <span class="sup">wax hollow</span>, which will form your relief, upon which you will cast your hollow part to make your seal or any other work. You could also cast a hollow part directly from the main part of your metal, even <span class="sup">should you want to cast</span> in <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>, which will not make the main part of your metal melt, if it has been lightly brushed with <span class="m">crushed chalk</span>, or covered with <span class="m">candle soot</span>, or with dried <span class="m">glair of egg</span>.

> When you have the <span class="m">wax</span> imprint of your seal, mold in a noyau this piece of <span class="m">wax</span>, which is hollow like your seal, and your noyau will make a mold similar to the imprint and the seal.

> Your <span class="m">wax</span> must be mixed with a color that has little body, so that you may better see your imprint. The <span class="m">lamp black</span> or <span class="m">soot black</span> is good for this. <span class="m">White wax</span> to do this is even better.

 
  

## Giving a medal the thickness that you wish

 
Having cast your first mold, mix some <span class="m">crocum</span> or well—ground <span class="m">iron scales</span> to make it <span class="sup">your mould</span> firmer. And having taken hold, and made your hollow part very neat, take some paste made of fine
