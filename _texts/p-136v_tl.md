##  <span class="m">latten</span> casting

 
 Take <span class="m">latten</span> from skillet pans, used to make baby's cereal, which is doulx and apt for the cast. Some people say that counter from <span class="pl">Germany</span> contain a lot of <span class="m">calamine</span>. However, when they are tempered, <span class="m">calamine</span> evaporates, <span class="m">calamine</span> mixed with melted <span class="m">latten</span> always evaporates, because <span class="m">latten</span> becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting. However, fresh <span class="m">calamine</span> and only fresh <span class="m">calamine</span>, which is blended with remelted <span class="m">latten</span>, makes <span class="m">latten</span> run, and allow a clean cast. Because <span class="m">calamine</span> which is added to remelted <span class="m">latten</span> is half—damaged compared with its natural state. This half—damaged <span class="m">calamine</span> make <span class="m">latten</span> porous and agitated because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh <span class="m">calamine</span> to melted <span class="m">latten</span>. Make sure to cast your mold very hot, you mold must become red—hot, like molds to cast <span class="m">gold</span>, <span class="m">silver</span>, <span class="m">copper</span> and metal. If you pour fresh <span class="m">calamine</span>, avoid its smoke which is pernicious. To cast a medal, I took thirty counters from <span class="pl">Germany</span> and xii <span class="m">clous de rosette</span> made of doulx <span class="m">latton</span>, like for claires medals which are made of soft <span class="m">latten</span>. This matter contains a lot of calamine like all kind of yellow <span class="m">latten</span>, and make a lot of smoke which prevent <span class="m">latten</span> from running, and make it porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, <span class="m">latten</span> must be as white as <span class="m">water</span>, or as melted <span class="m">silver</span> or as a polished mirror of <span class="m">steel</span>. The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated <span class="m">calamine</span> does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame that does not break and holds its own, the second <span class="x">casting</span> will come more neatly out of the mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of <span class="m">calamine</span>. If you add <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span> to your <span class="m">latten</span>, this <span class="m">latten</span> will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with <span class="m">huile tingente</span>. Do not use another sand than the above mentioned to mold a noyau, and the mold must become red—hot, like a mold to cast <span class="m">gold</span>. Make a lot of vents. If you cast yellow latten with the prepared tutty you will not get any smoke.

>   This metal is capricious to cast because of the smoke of the <span class="m">calamine</span>. Do not leave it out of the fire, as some do with <span class="m">silver</span>. Because when air or wind touch it, the mold gets cold at once. When you cast it, this metal always leaves burrs, like when casting <span class="m">glass</span>. <span class="pro">Foundry workers</span> do not usually use this very yellow <span class="m">latten</span> as much because of the <span class="m">calamine</span> which is heated. They cast <span class="m">red copper</span> and turn it yellow with fresh <span class="m">calamine</span>, or with some prepared tutty. Before casting, clean it with <span class="m">charcoal</span> with a quere made of <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">iron</span>. Then cover it with a cloth soaked in <span class="m">lard</span> blended with <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, or <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, in order to protect it from wind, which would cool it down.
