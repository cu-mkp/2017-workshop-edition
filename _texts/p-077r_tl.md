Dry some <span class="m">rosemary</span> in the month of May, then fill this bowl with <span class="m">powder</span> made of it, and place a lit <span class="m">charcoal</span> on top. And, receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth having closed your mouth well, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums, and other maladies.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Fatty earth</span>

 
<span class="pro">Founders</span>,to make the handles of their bells, use it. And before it is used, they beat it very well, then leave it to dry <span class="env">in the shade</span>, little by little & for a long time, and mold with it very neatly. But it must not be <span class="m">areneuse</span> <span class="del">&</span>; but rather well chosen & soft.
 
 
  

## Recipe for making <span class="m">bronze</span> and <span class="m">varnish</span> of many sorts

 
For making excellent <span class="m">varnish</span> with <span class="m">clear water</span> which you will use with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span> and immediately dries, for putting on <span class="m">paper</span>, a tablet, or another piece.
 
First, you will take five <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">eau de vye</span> and one <span class="ms">ounce</span> of <span class="m">benzoin</span>, crushed between two pieces of <span class="m">paper</span> or <span class="m">card</span> or in a <span class="tl">mortar</span>.
