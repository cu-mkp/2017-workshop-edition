## <span class="m">Talcum</span> mixed with the molds

 
I used the one from which I had extracted the <span class="m">oil</span>. I crushed it very finely even more into a <span class="m">steel</span> mortar with a pestle <span class="x">which was</span> rough like a file. I crushed it very finely into a cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the <span class="m">sand</span> and soaked both matters together, and I casted it en noyau. It molded very clean and there is no doubt that it will withstand fire.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Gold</span> casted very thinly

 
When goldsmiths have to solder something quickly but don't have enough time to forge it, they melt <span class="m">gold</span> and then they pour it on a cloth or on anything else that withstands fire. Then they flatten it swiftly with a hammer or another similar tool, and it <span class="x">the gold</span> is very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth.
 
Unalloyed pure <span class="m">gold</span> can be cast into a medal but not into herbs and lizards or other very delicate things if it is not alloyed.
 
A <span class="m">pansy</span> which is <span class="m">oiled</span> with <span class="m">wheat oil</span> can be cast with alloyed <span class="m">gold</span>.
 
And other fruit <span class="m">leaves</span>, but with branch<span class="x">es</span> that are not large and especially the leaves, once cast, can be soldered.
 
 
  

## Imitation <span class="m">diamonds set into the work</span>

 
Spread a fine layer of imprinting black wax on the inside of the frame then coat it inside with <span class="m">wheat oil</span>, then dust it with <span class="m">lamp smoke</span> because this color should not be lustrous for fake stones. Having done this, set your stone with a piece of wax then, with a steel point, or a small finishing hammer, join the edge of the frame with the stone, so that light cannot get in but be careful not to hit the stone, which would break.
