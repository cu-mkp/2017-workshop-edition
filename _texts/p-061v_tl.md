## <span class="m">Water</span> to give light for the <span class="pro">painter</span>

 
Distill some <span class="m">vine water</span> & put it into a big <span class="tl">bottle</span>. And behind this, put your <span class="tl">candle</span>, & it will not hinder your vision.
 
 
  

## <span class="pl">German</span> chassis

 
<span class="pl">Germans</span> who work in miniature make chassis not of <span class="m">glass</span>, but of <span class="m">canvas</span> smeared with <span class="m">clear turpentine varnish</span>, namely <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">turpentine oil</span> & <span class="ms">almost half</span> <span class="m">turpentine</span>, because this light, which is not as bright as <span class="m">glass</span>, makes them see larger features. And when they want to make something subtle like veins <span class="del">de</span> & similar things, they use <span class="tl">pinceaulx composed of two or three <span class="m"><span class="al">rat</span>whiskers</span></span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Azur d’esmail</span> in <span class="m">oil</span>

 
One needs too choose the most <span class="del">beautiful</span> delicate that will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in <span class="m">oil</span>. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can grind it well, not with <span class="m">water</span> but with <span class="m">oil</span>, & grind it thickly. Next lay it on your <span class="tl">palette</span> & mix in a little <span class="m">turpentine</span>, but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as thick as <span class="m">butter</span> or <span class="m">mortar</span>, & then, with a <span class="tl">fairly large pinceau</span>, work it by always moving the <span class="tl">pinceau</span> back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch across it in a jagged manner with <span class="del">the</span> the <span class="tl">tip of the pinceau</span>. The highlights will be made with <span class="del">d</span> the same thinned with <span class="m">ceruse</span>, which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, & such that you all but struggle to spread it with your <span class="tl">pinceau</span>. And it is all the better if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it is very subtle & thin without being ground, and does not run.

>   <span class="m">Azure</span> wants to be layered neatly, which is why <span class="del">quan</span> it always dies somewhat when layers it over old, already tarnished, <span class="m">azure</span> to mend an old panel. In such matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer & prime again, then put down the <span class="m">azure</span>. It is thus for almost all other colors. Also, <span class="m">azure</span> ground with <span class="m">oil</span> always remains shiny, which is not a good sign for <span class="m">azure</span> for this causes it to die.
 
 
  

## Grinding colors

 
A slab of <span class="del">marble & p</span> <span class="m">glass</span> <span class="ms">a <span class="del"><span class="m">glass</span></span> <span class="bp">thumb</span> thick</span> is more appropriate than anything else for grinding colours neatly, especially for <span class="m">lake</span> & for whites.
