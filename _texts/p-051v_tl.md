which is different from that of the <span class="pro">printers</span>, one needs to boil <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> or, even better <span class="m"><span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span>, for a <span class="tmp">long time</span>. & having boiled for a <span class="tmp">long time</span>, you will put in <span class="m"><span class="pa">garlic</span></span> & <span class="m">bread crusts</span> to rid it of grease & leave again to boil thoroughly, then finally you put in one <span class="ms">part</span> of <span class="m">lampblack</span> that you have previously ground on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> with <span class="m">oil</span> . And finally you will mix everything <span class="add">as long as</span> & until you see that the <span class="tl">plate</span> prints well. <span class="del">Which</span> And when you have spread the <span class="m">ink</span> on it, wipe the <span class="tl">plates</span> well with the surface of a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">white paper</span></span>. & do this until the <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> looks clean and then print. If you were to wipe the <span class="tl">plates</span> with a <span class="tl"><span class="m">linen</span>cloth</span>, it would remove the <span class="m">ink</span>. <span class="m"><span class="pa">Linseed</span> oil</span> thickens while boiling & becomes like a <span class="m">varnish</span> & is in danger of catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an <span class="env">open space</span> or in a <span class="env">place where the flame cannot cause damage</span>. Some burn <span class="m">tartar</span> until it is black & grind it with <span class="m">nonâ€”boiled <span class="pa">linseed</span> oil</span>, or <span class="m"><span class="pa">walnut</span> oil</span> which others find to be better. This <span class="m">black</span> is beautiful, but the <span class="m">lamp smoke</span> kind is blacker. When you want to print <span class="del">fr</span>, take with your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingertip</span></span> of the said <span class="m">black moderately thick</span>, the whole <span class="tl">plate</span> having first been cleaned in <span class="m">lye</span> as said, then, rub it with the surface of a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">white paper</span></span> until the <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> remains white & do not touch it with the <span class="bp">bare hand</span> <span class="del">because</span> but with a <span class="tl">piece of<span class="m">paper</span></span> applied across it. & having cleaned the <span class="tl">plate</span> perfectly, <span class="del">mi</span> rub again with a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">paper</span></span>, fold the edges & sides. Next, take a <span class="tl">small smooth table</span> & on this a <span class="tl">piece of <span class="m">felt</span></span>, then a few <span class="tl">sheets of <span class="m">paper</span></span> & finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between two <span class="tl">wet napkins</span>. And on this <span class="m">sheet</span> put your <span class="tl">plate</span> then another piece of <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span>, & finally another<span class="tl"> <span class="m">felt</span></span>. Then pass between the <span class="tl">rollers</span>. And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by always charging the <span class="tl">plate</span> with <span class="m">ink</span> & cleaning it as have done. But if you stop printing, the rest of the <span class="m">ink</span> will dry in the grooves of the <span class="tl">plate</span>. Thus you will have to let it boil in <span class="m">lye</span> or <span class="m">urine</span>, as already said, to clean it. The <span class="tl">rollers</span> must not be too loose.
