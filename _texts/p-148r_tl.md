not come out as clear as I wanted. I reheated it again, let it cool, put it into the <span class="m">bleach</span> again, and brushed <span class="x">it</span>. It came out very clear. In this way, you will do <span class="x">the same</span> for <span class="m">copper</span> and <span class="m">silver</span>. And if you want to give...
 
 
  

## Beautiful color for <span class="m">brass</span>

 
Having cleaned it well, as is stated, and brushed it well, boil it in water with <span class="m">curcuma root</span> or <span class="m">terra merita</span>, and it will become very beautiful.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Bleach</span>

 
If it is for <span class="m">silver</span>, do not grind your <span class="m">tartar</span> with <span class="sup">something made of</span> <span class="m">iron</span>, but with the handle of a hammer, because if you touch <span class="x">your tartar with iron</span> and <span class="x">end up</span> getting some <span class="m">iron</span> in your <span class="m">bleach</span>, the <span class="m">silver</span> will come out red, like <span class="m">copper</span>, and you will need to reheat it and put it back in the <span class="m">bleach</span>. Mix in nothing with your <span class="m">tartar</span> that should not enter the <span class="m">bleach</span>, because this ruins it. Do not let it spill out when it first starts to boil because all its strength is in it <span class="x">at this point</span>. <span class="m">Bleach</span> is made with one part pulverized <span class="m">tartar</span> and a half part of common <span class="m">salt</span>.
 
 
  

## Moulding the foot of the bittern, or eagle, or other birds for the base of saltcellars or vases

 
One commonly molds the foot and the legs up until the calf. And for this effect, one molds it in five pieces: the leg in two pieces, the top of the foot in two, and the bottom in one piece.

## <span class="m">Crocum Ferri</span>

 
To make this quickly, redden the <span class="m">filings</span> in an <span class="m">iron</span> ladle, stirring it often. Then sprinkle it with some good <span class="m">vinegar</span> and let it evaporate. And without taking it away from above the fire, let it redden and take flame. Having been cooled, pulverise <span class="x">it</span> on the <span class="m">marble</span> and return it to the heat, sprinkle with <span class="m">vinegar</span>, and then set it on fire. In this way it will soon be colored and made fine.
