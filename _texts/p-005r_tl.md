or <span class="m"><span class="pa">linen</span></span> & leave it thus for xx4 <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hours</span></span> & it will be engraved. But if you should want to engrave quickly, varnish all your work & boil it in the aforesaid liquor, and it will engrave quickly.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Steel</span> mirrors

 
\+They are called <span class="m">steel</span> <span class="sup">mirrors</span> because in the past they were usually made of <span class="m">steel</span> polished with <span class="m">emery paste</span>. But more easily, various kinds are made of <span class="m">cuivre franc</span>, which is <span class="m">rosette</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>, because these can be cast in a mold and made round, concave, convex or in whatever various shapes you want to represent.
 
So take half <span class="m">copper de rosette</span> and half soft <span class="m">tin</span>, i.e. fine and yet unused. Place them in a crucible, and first melt the <span class="m">copper</span>. Once it has been well melted, add the <span class="m">tin</span> and mix them together and cast that in a <span class="m">white stone</span> mold with no hole, and grease the mold, which should be moderately warm, with <span class="m">oil</span>. Then, once your mirror has been molded, you can polish it in this manner.
 
Set one <span class="sup">mirror</span> in <span class="m">plaster</span> to hold it firmly, then put the other one over it with fine sand between them, and rub one against the other, whether they are hollowed or flat, and thus you will polish both at once. If you want to polish them on both sides, you only have to switch them, which means putting the one that was polishing in the <span class="m">plaster</span> and <span class="x">using</span> the one which was in the <span class="m">plaster</span> to polish. Once they have been polished with <span class="m">arene</span> you can soften them with <span class="m">tripoli of Venice</span> that should not be <span class="m">sand</span>y, and then with <span class="m">paste</span>. You use <span class="m">water</span> with <span class="m">arene</span> to polish, but polishing with <span class="m">tripoli</span> and <span class="m">paste</span> is done dry. Once <span class="sup">the mirror</span> has been polished, you can set it.
 
 
  

## Concave mirrors

 
A concave mirror shaped in the aforesaid form produces an endless number of illusions which seem like magic. If one wants to see oneself from behind, you have to place the concave mirror on the ground on its foot, at a slant, and then look at it one step further. But if you look at it from a closer position, it shows you the right way up but with the face quite large and the hairs of your beard as thick as
