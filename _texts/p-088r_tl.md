## Vine

 
As with a bramble, it can be planted on both sides. & those who plant the larger side facing a slope say that it makes a larger stock. But it only has a higher point, because it grows higher.
 
 
  

## Mortars

 
The fine <span class="m">copper</span> mortars do not throw any flames, as long as the <span class="m">iron</span> pestle is not tempered. If the mortar is indeed made from <span class="m">metal</span>, when this is sour, in this case one makes the bottom of large mortars from fine <span class="m">copper</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Varnish</span>

 
<span class="m">Turpentine oil</span> <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m">good eau de vye</span> to render it desiccative. Heat it without mixing on the <span class="tl">chafing dish</span>, so that it mixes <span class="del">pu</span> by itself when melting. Next test on a very clean <span class="tl">knife</span>, & you will know then if it has enough body & if it does not run too much.
 
 
  

## Grafting

 
One knows from experience that the young shoot that <span class="del">is</span> enters into the incision on the sunny side takes hardly often at all when it is also bowed.
 
 
  

## <span class="pro">Baker</span>

 
<span class="m">Dust</span> guards wheat against being worm—eaten. And to clean it well when it is stained & like rust, pass some <span class="m">ashes</span> through a sieve & mix them with the <span class="m">wheat</span>, then sift the whole thing with a bolting cloth made from <span class="m">rough cloth</span> or <span class="m">canvas</span>. The <span class="m">ashes</span> will pass through & your <span class="m">wheat</span> will stay nicely yellow & very fine.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Looking—glass tin</span>

 
It makes the substance whiter.
