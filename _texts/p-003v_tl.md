instead of <span class="m">fine turpentine</span>. And you can put into two <span class="ms">lbs</span> of <span class="del">tou</span><span class="m">common turpentine</span> one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">fine turpentine oil</span> & proceed as with the other one. This one will cost you no more than five or six <span class="cn">sols</span> per <span class="ms">lb</span> & is sold for 40 <span class="cn">sols</span> per <span class="ms">lb</span>.

This <span class="tl">vessel</span> is used to make large quantities of <span class="m">turpentine oil</span>, that is to say a <span class="ms"><span class="ms">bucket</span> an <span class="tmp">hour</span></span>. And no matter which <span class="m">turpentine</span> it may be, whether fine or coarse. One needs to give, as you know, a little fire at the beginning. And always keep <span class="m">cold water</span> in the cooler on the top. The <span class="ms">lb</span> is sold at xii <span class="cn">sols</span>, & at the bottom of the <span class="tl">vessel</span> remains the <span class="m">colophony</span>, known as <span class="m">pix graeca</span>. <span class="m">Eau de vie</span> are also made well in this <span class="tl">vessel</span> and there is no need to distill it again. You do not need a <span class="tl">small oven</span> for this <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span>vessel</span>, but only <span class="m">charcoal</span> around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is round, you will place it on a <span class="tl">trivet</span>.

## For varnishing

 
<span class="m">Turpentine varnish</span> does not need any <span class="m">glue</span> because it is fat and viscous and it is not absorbed in the <span class="m">wood</span> like that of <span class="m">spike lavender</span> and <span class="m">sandarac</span>. Also, that of<span class="m">spike lavender</span> does not require any <span class="m">glue</span> on <span class="m">iron</span> & similar materials that do not absorb, but on <span class="m">wood</span> and on colors which <span class="del">have</span> <span class="add">do not have</span> <span class="m">gum</span> or <span class="m">colle de destrempe</span>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said <span class="m"> colle de retailles</span> & to let it dry & to varnish.
