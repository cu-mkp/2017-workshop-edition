## <span class="m">Sand from pulverised rock salt</span> and <span class="m">sand from the <span class="env">mine</span></span> finely ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> 

 
The one and the other, once very finely ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span>, after having crushed them dry well & beaten in the <span class="tl">mortar</span>, I mixed as much of one as the other, and having reworked them together on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, & passed them through a <span class="tl">double sieve</span> or through the <span class="tl">sleeve of a shirt</span> to mix them even better, I put them in <span class="tl"><span class="m">paper</span></span> & put them on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">marble</span></span> in a <span class="env">cellar</span>. After one <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">night</span></span>, they had been been moistened enough by themselves without dampened them further, because <span class="m">rock salt</span>, like all other <span class="m">salts</span>, dissolves <span class="env">in dampness</span>. I molded very neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be <span class="del">f</span> humid enough to release well.
 
 
  

## Mineral sand

 
It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it must be in one piece, & as if taken from a <span class="env">quarry</span> or <span class="env">rock formation</span>, & the deeper one takes it from, the better. The signs of its goodness is that it is thus amassed, and that when removing in the form of <span class="m">rock</span>, it comes out in lumps & <span class="del">qu</span> pieces which demonstrates its bond, & that it is not too lean.
 
However, it should <span class="sn">break apart between your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span></span> & have very small <span class="del">men</span> & delicate grains & of the same nature. If it is not delicate enough, you can pass & grind it finely, either through <span class="m">water</span>, or through a <span class="tl">sieve</span>, <span class="del">& when it</span> or on the <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, & in this way, from <span class="del">sil</span> leanness they become fat & well bound. You can mold with it in a <span class="del">sa</span> <span class="tl">frame</span> or in a noyau without <span class="m">cloth waste</span>, & try it with <span class="m">lead</span>, for if with this one it does not become porous & casts neatly, it will also behave well with <span class="m">copper</span>. Some say that the <span class="m">fat sands</span> do not want the <span class="m">metal</span> to be cast too hot. <span class="pro">Artisans who work on big works</span> & to save time, do not need to grind & seek the curiosities of <span class="m">artificial sands</span>, benefit from seeking some ready made in <span class="env">nature</span>, which has the finest grain possible, & for small works, they only pass it only through a <span class="tl">sieve</span>. But those who work in small works, finely grind it & grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of it.

>   The <span class="m"><span class="pa">bled</span> orbère</span> makes a tawny powder, very delicate & very soft, which once mixed could <span class="del">mix</span> mold very neatly. Try <span class="m"><span class="pa">wheat</span> flour</span> burned over a closed fire.
