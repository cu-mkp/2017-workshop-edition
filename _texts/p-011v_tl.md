## Color of <span class="m"><span class="pl">damascene</span> steel</span> on <span class="tl">knives</span>

 
Rub the <span class="m">steel</span> with <span class="m">common aquafortis</span>, mixing the said <span class="m">water</span> with <span class="m">earth</span>  & next rub the whole with <span class="m">ashes</span> or <span class="m">sand</span>. & the <span class="m">gold</span>will touch & the <span class="m">silver</span> as on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">touchstone</span></span>.

 
  

## Getting rid of red <span class="bp">eyes</span> or black <span class="bp">eyes</span>

 
Make two small licks of <span class="m">raw <span class="al">mutton</span> flesh</span>, and with a blindfold, apply it at night on your <span class="bp">eyes</span>.

 
  

## For coating with <span class="m">or mat</span>

 
There is nothing better than the black varnish of <span class="pro">swordâ€”makers</span> to make a ground layer because it dries immediately & makes the <span class="m">gold</span> appear very beautiful.
 
 
  

## For <span class="tl"><span class="m">diamond</span> points</span> for engraving

 
These are for tracing what you want to draw on <span class="m">stones</span> & engrave, & when these <span class="tl">points</span> are fatty & cannot bite, one needs to rub them <span class="m">diamond</span> against <span class="m">diamond</span>. One rubs them with <span class="del">diamond</span> <span class="tl"><span class="m">pumice stone powder</span></span>. One needs also to unpolish on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">lead</span> wheel</span> either the <span class="m">stone</span> or the <span class="m">glass</span> on which you want to engrave, for the polish, which is like <span class="m">varnish</span> on <span class="m">glass</span>, prevents the <span class="m">diamond</span> or <span class="m">sapphire</span> from biting well. <span class="del">But</span> This is why it does not bite easily on the <span class="m">hoof</span>, which is polished & fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites easily.

 
  

## Polishing a <span class="tl"><span class="m">copper</span> wheel</span>

 
Instead of polishing your <span class="m">stone</span>, it is necessary to remove the grease by rubbing the flesh side of a piece of <span class="m">leather</span> <span class="sup">on the <span class="tl">wheel</span></span>, all while spinning the <span class="tl">wheel</span> if you have not worked on it in a long time.
