*[continued]*
  
 round <span class="tl">plane</span>, also two—handed, and then with a small narrow <span class="tl">plane</span>, it is gutted and scoured for half a foot towards the end of the heel. And a shorter scouring is better so that the sword does not always cut the scabbard.
 
 The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth and on top of it is the shape of the knife.
 
 The stitch which is a <span class="m">leather</span> rim set on the edge of the knife shape is made to stop the sword frogs.
 
 When the small planks are well flattened, the sword is laid down on them and with a <span class="tl">black stone</span> one marks the width and length of the blade. Then with a <span class="tl">chisel</span> the excess is cut. And a <span class="tl">plane</span> is used to even properly following the marks.
 
 Then the two small planks are stuck edge to edge <span class="add">and all around</span> only following the knife shape and not elsewhere. And this is to make the scabbard <span class="m">velvet leather</span> hold.
 
 Then the sword is put in the small planks and it is set in the scabbard which is sewed. And they rub what is glued directly on the knife shape with some <span class="m">tallow</span> to run into the scabbard.
 
 The scabbard is made of <span class="al">calf</span> or <span class="al">sheep</span> <span class="m">leather</span>, the <span class="al">calf</span> ones are in all one piece, but not the <span class="al">sheep</span> ones. When swords are long, they are made of several patches sewn between <span class="m">leather</span> and <span class="m">flesh</span> and then they rub firmly the stitching with a <span class="m">boxwood</span> piece to cover and even it. From a good <span class="al">calf</span> <span class="m">skin</span>, 8 or 9 or 10 scabbards can be made. A <span class="pro">workman</span> can easily make 6 a day. If they are too thick, they are lightly thinned out with a plane. If the <span class="m">skin</span> is too hard, it is lightly dipped in some lukewarm <span class="m">water</span> but not for long. Next, the same worker who worked <span class="m">wood</span> piece has to adjust the scabbard in order for it to be well done. It is true that for common people, there are some good already all made, but they never fit perfectly. When the scabbard is made and sewed with black <span class="m">thread</span>, it is rubbed with a <span class="m">boxwood</span> piece or a slightly <span class="m">oiled</span> cloth . The good <span class="al">cow</span> <span class="m">leather</span> scabbard is the best of all and costs also more than all except the <span class="m">velvet</span> ones. Under the <span class="m">velvet</span> one usually put plain <span class="m">canvas</span> or a <span class="al">sheep</span> <span class="m">skin</span> scabbard or a <span class="m">parchment</span> layer. But the best scabbard is a waxed scabbard covered with either <span class="m">velvet</span> or <span class="al">calf</span> <span class="m">skin</span>. One covers the wood with thin canvas, which one then waxes, and covers in <span class="m">velour</span> or <span class="al">calf</span> <span class="m">skin</span>. A <span class="m">waxed</span> scabbard is worth at least 30 cents, a <span class="al">cow</span> leather one, 20 cents.
