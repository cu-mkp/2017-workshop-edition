## For teeth

 
<span class="m">Sal ammoniac</span> i ℥, <span class="m">rock salt</span> 1 ℥, <span class="m">alum</span> half ℥. Make <span class="m">water</span> with the cornue, and no matter how little of it you touch the tooth with, the tartar and blackness will go away. It is true that it has a bad odor, but you can mix it with <span class="m">rose honey</span> and a little <span class="m">clove oil</span> or <span class="m">cinnamon<span class="sup"> oil</span></span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Antimony oil</span>

 
It yellows quite strongly, even <span class="m">silver</span>, if you put it on it once heated. 
 
 
  

## Against falling sickness or dizziness

 
Wear, hung to your collar, some root of <span class="m">paeonia</span> which has been plucked when the moon is waning. 
 
 
  

## Crucibles

 
Those from <span class="pl">Bayonne</span>, which seem to be made of <span class="m">grés</span> are better, for they last, without comparison, longer than others. And because they are not very thick, one wastes less <span class="m">charcoal</span> melting <span class="m">gold</span> & <span class="m">silver</span>, for they heat quickly. They do not absorb as much <span class="m">silver</span> as much as the others, & for this reason, there is not much <span class="m">laveures</span> to be found in them. They are less likely to fall over as others that have a flat foot. 
 
 
  

## Against diarrhea and dysentery

 
Against diarrhea, it is good to use preserve of <span class="m">symphytum</span>, also <span class="x">known as</span> <span class="m">consolida maior</span>. And if it is against dysentery, you can rub the temples, the hollow of the hands, and the sole of the feet with <span class="m">wax oil</span> and take a drop of two of it with a spoonful of <span class="m">broth</span>. The root of <span class="m">consolida maior</span>, crushed and put between <span class="del">pieces</span> cuts in a piece of <span class="m"><span class="al">beef</span></span>, then boiled, rejoins them, as it is said.
