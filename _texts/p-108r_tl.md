To hold the noyaux, some use <span class="tl"><span class="m">wire of the same metal</span> that they cast</span>, because it reduces <span class="del">with</span> & melts with its counterpart, but because when melting or folding, the noyau changes, some find it better to <span class="del">r</span> use <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron wire</span></span>, sharpened at the ends, because it holds firmer & having delicate ends, it appears as no more than a point of a needle. And one can apply <span class="m">gold</span> or <span class="m">silver</span>, before using it for a work. If it makes a hole, one covers it with a small <span class="tl">chisel</span>.
 
<span class="m">Eau de vye</span> prevents the sand from becoming porous & does not make little holes on the edges of the <span class="tl">mold</span> if the thing to mold is well dampened with it. The holes & pustules & bubbles are not made at the place of the <span class="tl">mold</span> which is thick, but at the edges which are thinner.
 
One casts with <span class="m">common silver</span> with which <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> commonly work, which forms a mediocre <span class="del">Et que</span> alloy. And when one would cast with <span class="m">solder</span>, it would run even better.
 
<span class="m">Spalt</span> is a <span class="m">whitish stone</span> which can be found in <span class="pl">Germany</span>, & mainly in <span class="pl">Augsburg</span>, which one uses for the most excellent sand that can be found for <span class="m">lead</span>, <span class="m">tin</span>, <span class="m">copper</span>, <span class="m">silver</span> & <span class="m">gold</span>. And the more it is used, the better it is. It is appropriate for casting flat things in a chassis. For round things, it is not as fitting nor does it hold in the fire as well as the above mentioned made with <span class="m">plaster</span>.
 
The shreds of <span class="del">cui</span> thick, <span class="m">greasy leather</span> are <span class="del">p</span><span class="add">b</span> good to cast in the <span class="m">melted copper and latten</span>, for it cleans it & removes from it all its <span class="m">filth</span>. 
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Spalt</span>

 
<span class="m">Spalt</span> is white like <span class="m">cooked plaster</span> and can be found in mounds and <span class="m">stones</span> formed in long scales & long veins. It is very soft, such that with a <span class="tl"><span class="bp">fingernail</span></span> one can scrape it & makes a powder like our <span class="m">chalk from <span class="pl">Champagne</span></span>. And because everything which comes from the <span class="env">earth</span> is mixed with some other substance, to purify it, one grinds it, coming from the <span class="env">quarry</span>, quite coarsely, then one mixes it <span class="m">essence of sal ammoniac</span>. And, by putting in a piece the <span class="ms">size of a <span class="pa">walnut</span></span> in a large <span class="tl">bottle</span> of <span class="m">water</span> and
