>   * To make <span class="m">or mat</span> beautiful, put in a little <span class="m">varnish</span> or <span class="m">fatty oil</span>, not from that which is made from the cleaning of <span class="tl">pinceaulx</span>, but the pure, which is made fatty <span class="env">in the sun</span> or mixed with <span class="m">ceruse</span>.
 
<span class="m">Or mat</span> of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than <span class="del">es</span> <span class="add"><span class="m">burnished gold</span></span>, and lasts longer <span class="env">in the rain</span>, & besides, & is made sooner. <span class="m">Burnished gold</span> is cracked <span class="tmp">with time</span> & comes apart <span class="env">in the rain</span>.
 
 
  

## Preventing <span class="bp">teats</span> from swelling <span class="del">d</span> <span class="add">or to diminish overly large ones</span>

 
Take large <span class="m">loaves of bread</span> freshly drawn from the <span class="tl">oven</span> & split them in half &, as hot as may be done, apply them <span class="del">& they</span> & do this 3 times a <span class="tmp">day</span> & continue 4 or 5 <span class="tmp">days</span>. Next, make a plaster with <span class="m"><span class="pl">Venice</span> turpentine</span> or better, <span class="m">common turpentine</span>. Mix in <span class="m"><span class="pa">sumac</span></span>, <span class="m"><span class="pa">sloes</span></span> from bushes, <span class="m"><span class="pa">quince</span> seeds</span>, <span class="pa"><span class="pa">pomegranate</span> flowers</span>, <span class="m"><span class="pa">olive tree</span> leaves</span>, & the like, boiled, & mix with the <span class="m">turpentine</span>. But, I forgot, one needs, after having applied the hot <span class="m">bread</span>, which softens & makes one sweat, to put on <span class="tl">linens</span> soaked with <span class="m">water from a honey beehive</span>, that is to say <span class="m">honey</span> & <span class="m">wax</span> extracted all together from the honeycomb.
 
 
  

## For attracting <span class="al">pigeons</span>

 
Fry <span class="m">hempseed</span> in a <span class="tl">pan</span> with <span class="m">oil</span> & give some of it to the <span class="al">pigeons</span>.
 
 
  

## Against the bruising of <span class="bp">eyes</span>

 
At <span class="tmp">night</span>, apply <span class="m">very thin sheets of lead</span>. Singular remedy.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Pinceaulx</span>

 
To make them well, cut the <span class="m">hair from the tail of a <span class="al">squirrel</span>’s fur</span>, <span class="ms">as much in one go as one can hold in a <span class="m">card</span> folded up into a small tube</span>. And putting it thus into the aforesaid folded <span class="m">card</span>, tap <span class="add">it</span> & shake <span class="add">it</span> such that the <span class="m">hair</span> gathers together & becomes of the same length. Put one or two <span class="m">bristles of a <span class="al">rat</span>’s whiskers</span> in the middle, then, grabbing it with the fist & pinching it well with the <span class="bp">thumb</span> & <span class="bp">index finger</span>, thoroughly dip the tip of all this <span class="m">hair</span> in <span class="m">water</span>, then, moving close to
