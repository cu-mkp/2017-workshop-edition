## <span class="pro">Founder</span>

 
Kitchen pots are made well, in order not to give a <span class="sn">bad taste to the meat</span>, with the same <span class="m">metal the bells are made of</span>. It is true that <span class="pro">foun<span class="del">ables</span><span class="add">ders</span></span> mix in more <span class="m">latten</span> to make them yellower, in order to sell them better. But the <span class="m">latten</span> by itself, &simply by touching it, is <span class="sn">stinking</span> & <span class="sn">bad smelling</span>.
 
<span class="m">Latten</span> does not lose, or very slightly, its <span class="m">calamine</span> in an <span class="tl">air furnace</span> when it is melted in a <span class="tl">crucible</span>, nor does it lose it in a <span class="tl"><span class="m">wood</span> furnace</span>, but it does in a <span class="tl">bellows furnace</span> because <span class="tl">bellows</span> give intense flames.
 
 
  

## <span class="tl">Air furnace</span>

 
It is necessary that the mouth be narrower than the bottom. And it is enough if the <span class="tl">crucible</span> can enter in it, & if there is enough space to remove & take it with <span class="tl">pincers</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="pro">Glassmakers</span>' glass</span>

 
It is said that in <span class="pl">Lorraine</span> & <span class="pl">Flanders</span> <span class="m">linking glass</span> is made of <span class="m"><span class="pa">fern</span> ashes</span> & <span class="m">pebbles</span>. First they blow up a long still that another worker breaks off and cuts vertically with big shears. Then this long still expands by being placed on a <span class="tl"><span class="m">stone</span></span> or large <span class="tl">platine</span> in a <span class="tl">furnace</span> slightly colder than one for melting. Furthermore, they flatten it by rolling <span class="sup">over</span> it a big & long <span class="tl"><span class="m">iron</span> stick</span>. Then they take it out of the annealing <span class="tl">furnace</span>. Similarly, they make some in <span class="pl">England</span> that are quite beautiful. Close to <span class="pl">Rouen</span> in <span class="pl">France</span>, <span class="m">flat glass</span> is made with some <span class="del">sel de</span> <span class="m"><span class="pa">saltworth</span></span> & <span class="m">pebbles</span> and is whiter & softer than the <span class="pl">Lorraine</span> one, because it can be melted with a <span class="tl">candle</span>, unlike the <span class="pl">Lorraine</span> one. This <span class="m">flat glass</span> is blown up in a long still —— the end of which someone else cuts and blows up whilst turning it, then flattens it using a <span class="tl">plane</span> which is on the ground, <span class="del">A</span> and then reheats it. Thus the middle of the still, where it began, always stays the same.

> The <span class="m">glass</span>, when wet, can be broken again with the flame of a <span class="tl">candle</span>, but not as precisely as with <span class="tl">hot <span class="m">iron</span></span>.
