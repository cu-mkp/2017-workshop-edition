eat by itself. And so that he likes it better, you can add to the meat and the egg some mealworm, because nightingales love them.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Crocum ferri</span>

 
It is excellent applied to wounds to stop the bleeding. The best one is made of <span class="m">needle filings</span>.

>   <span class="m">Crocum ferri</span> hardens moulds that have been reheated, the more <span class="m">feather alum</span> is added, the softer and pliant they become.
 
 
  

## Anatomy

 
You must skin the animal and boil it. Or skin it and put it into <span class="m">quicklime</span>.
 
 
  

## Making <span class="m">silver</span> runny

 
If it is for a large work, <span class="m">arsenic</span> and pulverized <span class="m">tartar</span> thrown into melted <span class="m">silver</span>, makes the <span class="m">silver</span> runny. This is enough <span class="x">for silver.</span> But for subtle work, you need <span class="m">bronze, filings, copper,</span> even <span class="m">antimony</span>, <span class="m">sublimate</span>, all neatly ground. All of this makes a mass that does not get smaller. If the <span class="m">plaster</span> is good, you do not need to add <span class="m">crocum</span> for <span class="m">silver</span>, but one puts in more <span class="m">feather alum</span>. It is also necessary to add melted <span class="m">common salt</span>, and some <span class="m">saltpeter</span> and the aforementioned drugs: <span class="m">arsenic, tartar, bronze, copper filings, antimony</span> &

>  Flowers can also be kept in their same beauty in distilled <span class="m">vinegar</span> in a vase, well—sealed so it takes no draft, well—sealed with <span class="m">wax</span> and <span class="m">mastic</span>. Carnations and roses, the residue of common <span class="m">vinegar</span> makes them rot. If the <span class="m">sand</span> makes dust, and sticks to the flowers and hardly comes off with a brush, it is no good. The most lean is the best.
 
 
  

## Keeping dried flowers in the same condition all year

This is a rare secret, and which is pleasing for decorating tables, rooms, studies out of season when winter denies you flowers. Be advised to pick them when they are in full vigor and still growing, because if you take them when no longer in bloom or when they are starting to wilt, they will not keep. Having therefore chosen them, take some <span class="m">sand</span>, the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like the one <span class="pro">goldsmiths</span> use to sand <span class="m">enamel</span>, or like the one <span class="x">used</span> for engraving. But this <span class="m">sand</span> must not be dusty at all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground or poured it, because it is
