## Repairing things that have been cast

 
 It happens often that what you have cast has metal overflow, through a fault in the mold, the cast, or the <span class="m">metal</span>. Faults in the mold arise from <span class="m">plaster</span> which is not hard and strong and cannot withstand fire, which is corrected by mixing in <span class="m">crocum</span>. If you use too much <span class="m">tin</span> to cast things that are of an average thickness, it will not release well, because tin that is cast thickly, shrinks and bubbles. Similarly, the things you need to mold hollow can be fantastical to cast. If therefore you happen to have a flaw, have at your disposal a small <span class="m">leather</span> pouch full of fine sand, and having placed it on the edge of a <span class="pro">goldsmith</span>'s bench, where one files, place upon it your work, and secure it there with a rope which passes underneath your foot. The sand in your pouch will respond <span class="sup">to the pressure of your foot</span>, and will immediately be thicker on one side and thinner on the other. Then immediately with a burin, outline and quickly make the subtle parts of your cast which did not come out, or which did not come out distinctly enough, or with a file or a chaple, remove your <span class="m">metal</span> overflow. If there is a flaw in your materials that has left a hole or something too hollow, scrape it with a burin and make notches around that hole, then make an imprint of this with <span class="m">wax</span>. And place this imprint on a fine <span class="m">lead</span> blade, and in this way mark the appropriate size of <span class="m">lead</span>, or of any other alloy which resembles your casting material the most. Then place this piece of work on the notched part and attach it well with some with <span class="m">yellow latten</span> or <span class="m">copper</span> wire — and if you are dealing with <span class="m">tin</span> or <span class="m">lead</span> rub in some <span class="m">rosin</span> around the edge — and apply all around it <span class="sup">the replacement piece</span> some little thin pieces of <span class="m">solder</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>, or any other thing. Then with a hot <span class="m">iron</span>, or above the heat source of the forge, solder it together, and then repair all of this with the aforesaid tools and the appropriate chisels.
