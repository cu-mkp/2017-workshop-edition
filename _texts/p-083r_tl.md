## Sand @ for <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Recipe <span class="m">grey soot from the furnace of the <span class="pro">silversmiths</span></span>, <span class="m">quick lime</span>, and flour,<span class="ms">ana</span>, moistened according to the art, being the finest possible.
 
> *at left top margin*
> 
> 
>   The <span class="m">grey soot of <span class="pro">locksmiths</span></span>, which is held in the <span class="tl">forge</span>, is very fine once ground, molds very neatly, & releases very well.
 
 
  

## Sand for <span class="m">copper</span> medals

 
Recipe <span class="m">hat felt burnt</span> <span class="add">over a covered fire</span>, <span class="m">dross of iron</span>, & <span class="m">burnt bone</span>, all of which ground very finely & crushed & watered with <span class="m">saltwater</span>; & make a paste of it & mold it, & wipe it over a <span class="m">straw</span> fire. <span class="add"> @ These three sands, pulverized and very finely ground on <span class="tl"><span class="m">porphyry</span></span>, mold well, and I think that separately each of them is very good. <span class="m">Burnt hat felt</span> molds very neatly and releases very neatly.</span>
 
> *at left top margin*
> 
> 
>   <span class="m">Plaster</span> molds very neatly but it becomes porous. <span class="m">Bone</span> has scarcely any body unless it has <span class="m">iron dross</span>. <span class="m">Felt</span> makes it release. 
 
 
  

## Another sand

 
 <span class="m">Charcoal of <span class="pa">vine</span> shoots</span> & <span class="m">clay earth</span>, <span class="del">bien recuitte & </span> <span class="add">well</span> <span class="tl">sieved</span>, as much of one as the other, & join them together with <span class="m">well—beaten eggs’ glair</span>, then calcine in the <span class="tl">furnace</span>, & to use it, moisten it with <span class="m">vinegar</span>.
 
 
  

## Another for <span class="m">lead</span>

 
Recipe <span class="m">finely crushed slate</span>, & <span class="m"><span class="del">calcined</span> pumice stone</span> mixed together. Calcine them in a well covered <span class="tl">pot</span>, & thrice stoppered over a good fire, & each time moisten them with <span class="m">varnish</span>.
 
 
  

## Another

 
Recipe <span class="del">p</span> a <span class="m">tile little baked, ground</span> & moistened in <span class="m">white wine</span> with <span class="m">burnt black trasse paper</span>. And if you add <span class="m">burnt <span class="al">horse</span> dung</span>, it will be all the better. Moisten with <span class="m">egg glair</span>.
 
> *at left bottom margin*
> 
> 
>   <span class="m">Trasse paper burnt</span> over a closed fire is reduced just as <span class="m">charcoal</span> & very soft black, molds neatly & makes it release well mixed with the others.
 
 
  

## Excellent sand

 
<span class="m">Alabaster, calcined</span> in a <span class="tl">crucible</span> over <span class="m">charcoal</span> fire so that when touching it, it turns into powder. Once cold, pulverise it finely, pass it through a <span class="tl">double sieve</span>, & and render it as if impalpable. And <span class="del">d</span> with one <span class="ms">lb</span> of <span class="m">alabaster</span>, one needs one <span class="ms">℥</span> of <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>. Mix well & incorporate everything together, then put them in a <span class="del"><span class="env">cellar</span></span> <span class="env">cellar</span> or a <span class="env">damp place</span>. And with this paste, mold what you will need, & next dry the <span class="tl">mold</span> in the fire, & cast whatever you wish, while the sand is hot. And you will cast as neatly as the main one, & the sand can still be used by placing it in a <span class="env">damp place</span> & drying it in the fire.
