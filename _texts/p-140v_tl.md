 to engrave on <span class="m">silver</span> & <span class="m">copper</span> with aqua fortis. With this <span class="x"><span class="m">wax</span></span> too, one fills the cavity of a relief, & then casts in this cavity, with moistened <span class="m">sand</span>, which immediately takes the relief very neatly. And then you can cast its cavity on it in <span class="m">copper</span>, <span class="m">gold</span>, and <span class="m">silver</span>, and make really singular seals.

## To cast in <span class="m">sulfur</span>

 
 To cast neatly in <span class="m">sulfur</span>, arrange the pith of <span class="m">bread</span> under the brazier, as you know. Mold whatever you want into it & let it dry & you will have very neat work.

## Molding and shrinking a large shape

 
 Mold it with the pith of bread just out of the oven, or like that aforementioned, & in drying out it will shrink & consequently so will the medal that you will cast. By these means — lengthening out or enlarging the imprinted bread — you can vary the shape & from one face make several different ones. The <span class="m">bread</span> straight from the oven is best. And the one which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast <span class="m">sulfur</span> without letting the imprint on the <span class="m">bread</span> dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But, if you want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent.
 
 
  

## Casting of <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span> in <span class="m">plaster</span>

 
 If you want to cast any flat medal or any animal that is not very heavy, and that must not be burnt inside the mold, you can indeed cast in mixed <span class="m">plaster</span> & <span class="m">brique</span>, as above; and not in <span class="m">plaster</span> alone, because it contracts too much feeling an ardent fire if it is not so mixed. But, with the <span class="m">brick</span>, it holds well. However, take heed to dry out your mold at length & on a slow fire & with patience, because there is no need to reheat it. But when your work is of <span class="m">flowers</span> or other things that want their mold to be reheated & set ablaze, mix the plaster with <span class="m">stone alum</span> & even with <span class="m">crocum</span>. I have molded in very neat <span class="m">plaster</span> & <span class="m">brick</span> & it has sustained several castings.

>   I tried both <span class="m">plaster</span> & <span class="m">brick</span> alone and molded en noyau with like the others. My mold was very clean, having lightly <span class="m">oiled</span> & rubbed my medal with <span class="m">spirits</span>. I made my casting wide at the entrance, narrowing it as it goes along until it reaches the medal which is very thin. I notched the casting which embraced the medal well. I dried the mold out well on a slow fire & finally, I heated it well without turning it red. I let it cool in such a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made a line of 4 ℥ of <span class="m">tin</span>, & ix deniers of <span class="m">lead</span>. I cast it red, and it was quite good and beautiful. Afterwards I put xii deniers of <span class="m">lead</span>on top of 4 ℥ of <span class="m">tin</span>. It is very good & beautiful.

>   When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat it for <span class="m">lead</span> and <span class="m">tin</span>. But for <span class="m">flowers</span> and other things that must be burned, it is.
