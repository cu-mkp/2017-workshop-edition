## <span class="m">Herbs</span> difficult to burn in the mold

 
Mold them in two or three castings; being annealed, your mold will open, and it will be easier to extract the <span class="m">charcoal</span> from inside.

## molded letter <span class="m">paper</span>

 
Write with some <span class="m">ink</span> well thickened with gum or any other <span class="m">color dye</span> which has body, and which is not erased if dampened with brandy. Then put your paper on the sheet of clay, and dampen it with <span class="m">brandy</span>. Cast both sides <span class="x">of paper</span>.
 
 
  

## Adorning beds, mirrors and similar things

 
Model any drawing in half relief on a flat <span class="m">slate</span> in order to set it on round or flat things. Cast with very fine <span class="m">tin</span>, then you can gild it with <span class="m">gold</span> leaf, and set it wherever you want. Fill the bottom of the relief with small <span class="m">rubies</span>, <span class="m">orpiment</span>, or any colored little <span class="m">grains</span>.
 
 
  

## Training a dog 

 
You need to keep your dog attached; when it does what you command, to win its love, give it a piece of <span class="m">cheese</span> that was held under the armpit. This <span class="m">cheese</span> would be a bad drug if the master, or the apprentice, is red—haired. 
 
 
  

## Molded <span class="m">wax</span>

 
Wax representations made from <span class="m">white lead</span> and <span class="m">cerussite</span> are not made to be burned and melted in a mold where you want to cast <span class="m">silver</span> and <span class="m">gold</span>; this would make it brittle. Moreover if you use such a mold, the <span class="m">wax</span> would be stripped thanks to the violence of the fire which makes it boil, and the mixture made of <span class="m">cerrusite</span> or any other metal would attack the mold. That's why if you want to sketch things

>   \+ <span class="m">White wax</span> is more delicate than the other, and it doesn't leave any filth when you want to mold it as a core, or to mold hollow.
