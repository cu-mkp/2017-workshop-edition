## Casting <span class="m">gold</span>

 
Take a crusol that can contain a certain amount, as you wish to place roughly crushed <span class="m">borax</span> into it. Place <span class="x">the <span class="m">borax</span></span> at the bottom and then the <span class="m">gold</span> on top of it. Arrange the <span class="m">coal</span> in the forge in such a way that the wind of the bellow will blow above the crusol and no on its side as it would cool it down and would not heat it enough. Also, make sure it is three good <span class="ms"><span class="bp">fingers</span></span> away from the wall of the forge so that it is quite surrounded by <span class="m">coal</span>. Allow the crusol to anneal until it is quite red. Then, have your boy strongly blow the bellow with long pushes, as in this manner it heats it better. Meanwhile, once the <span class="m">gold</span> will be melted, blow a small bellow above it. Because <span class="x">otherwise</span> the <span class="m">gold</span> would turn sour and would acquire some kind of coat. As long as there will be some swirling smoke as you blow this way, it means that it is not soft enough for the cast. Therefore, uncover the melting pot and without displacing it and without stopping the bellow, tilt it towards you so you may well see what is inside. Throw a ferue of <span class="m">borax</span> in it and blow wind towards it with the small bellow in a jerky fashion. Should there be <span class="m">coal</span> inside, blow a bit stronger to make them come out. And if the <span class="m">gold</span> still smokes and swirls, add <span class="m">borax</span> again and blow above it. Beware that it is still sour and not soft enough, it will show a coat when you blow it as if it had cooled down. By contrast, if it does not show this sign, it is soft enough. Then, blow strongly so that it <span class="x">the <span class="m">gold</span></span> is quite heated and once you think it is hot enough, throw colour on top of it in the crusol and the colour should be composed as following: <span class="m">verdigris</span>, <span class="m">saltpeter</span>, <span class="m">sal ammoniac</span>, and a bit of <span class="m">borax</span>. And continue blowing with the small bellows, and the <span class="m">gold</span> will turn shiny like
