## Reheating <span class="tl">molds</span>

 
The <span class="tl">frames</span> readily dry out & do not reheat. For reheating is actually <span class="del">for the second time</span> to redden & inflame the <span class="tl">molds</span> in the fire, and drying out is to let the <span class="tl">molds</span> dry themselves, or to make their dampness evaporate by placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one. <span class="tl">Noyau molds</span> readily reheat & <span class="tl">frame molds</span> dry out.
 
 
  

## <span class="m"><span class="m">Latten</span> smoke</span>

 
 It is good to reheat in it the <span class="tl">molds for casting <span class="m">latten</span></span>, for this <span class="del">g</span><span class="add">c</span> <span class="m">yellow filth</span>, which appears nevertheless to refill the <span class="tl">molds</span>, casts very neatly, being of the same nature.
 
 
  

## For <span class="m">red copper</span>

 
When it is melted, it is good to throw in a little <span class="m">fine tin</span>, for this makes it run.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Clay earth</span>

 
This one, moistened & well beaten & kneaded as you know, is necessary for you to make the contour for containing your <span class="tl">molds</span>. But take heed that it not be too soft, but rather as if half dry, that <span class="del">i</span><span class="add">e</span>l<span class="add">le</span> it does <span class="sn">not attack your <span class="tl"><span class="bp">hands</span></span></span>, because otherwise it would attack your work. Always keep it <span class="env">in a damp place</span>, and make holes in it, and fill them with <span class="m">water</span>, to keep it fresh.

## <span class="m">Iron wire</span>

 
You need to have enough provisions of different thicknesses, according to the <span class="tl">molds</span> that you want to make, some <span class="ms">large like cord, some <span class="ill"></span></span> & some <span class="ms">thin <span class="del">p</span>, like the large cords of a <span class="mu">spinet</span>, for small works</span>. You make, once <span class="del">de</span> reheated, clamps from it to close the <span class="tl">molds</span> & the points, like needles of different lengths, according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded & keep it subjected. <span class="tl">Needles</span> would not be good for this because it is necessary that their points be empty & of the same thickness throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as you have need of. <span class="m">Iron wire is firmer</span> than <span class="m">that of latten</span>.
