## Reheating molds

 
The frames readily dry out & do not reheat. For reheating is actually to redden & inflame the molds in the fire, and drying out is to let the molds dry themselves, or to make their dampness evaporate by placing them in front of a flaming fire or a charcoal one. Noyau molds readily reheat & frame molds dry out.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Latten</span> <span class="m">smoke</span>

 
 It is good to reheat in it the molds for casting <span class="m">latten</span>, for this yellow <span class="m">filth</span>, which appears nevertheless to refill the molds, casts very neatly, being of the same nature.
 
 
  

## For <span class="m">red copper</span>

 
When it is melted, it is good to throw in a little fine <span class="m">tin</span>, for this makes it run.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Clay earth</span>

 
This one, moistened & well beaten & kneaded as you know, is necessary for you to make the contour for containing your molds. But take heed that it not be too soft, but rather as if half dry, that it does not attack your hands, because otherwise it would attack your work. Always keep it in a damp place, and make holes in it, and fill them with water, to keep it fresh.

## <span class="m">Iron</span> wire

 
You need to have enough provisions of different thicknesses, according to the molds that you want to make, some large like cord, some <span class="ill"></span> & some thin, like the large cords of a spinet, for small works. You make, once reheated, clamps from it to close the molds & the points, like needles of different lengths, according to your need, to pierce the animal to be molded & keep it subjected. Needles would not be good for this because it is necessary that their points be empty & of the same thickness throughout, except at the point. And then, one must make them as long as you have need of. <span class="m">Iron</span> wire is firmer than that of <span class="m">latten</span>.
