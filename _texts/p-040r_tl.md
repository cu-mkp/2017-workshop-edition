being at all expert in painting. If your <span class="m">glass</span> pane is bulging as if taken from the belly of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your <span class="m">turpentine</span> colors to your <span class="m">glass</span> panes, first place them on a hot tile &, once they are hot, spread your colors & leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your <span class="m">tin</span> sheet.
 
 
  

## Dye

 
Some take the root of <span class="pa">Lapathium acutum maius</span>, which looks like <span class="pa"><span class="pro">monk</span>’s rhubarb</span> or <span class="pa">sorrel</span>, & with the root, which is yellow in <span class="tmp">summer</span>, they dye thread & similar things.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Aqua fortis</span>

 
Some put <span class="del">on</span> <span class="add">for</span> four <span class="ms">pounds</span> of substance of<span class="m">aqua fortis</span> <span class="del">four</span> that is in the <span class="tl">retort</span> four <span class="ms">ounces</span> of <span class="m">common water</span> in the <span class="tl">receptacle</span>, which is better than putting it into the <span class="tl">retort</span>. One causes <span class="m">alum</span> to de—phlegm & calcine, so that the <span class="m">water</span> does not have as much dregs. Many make it without de—phlegming the <span class="m">alum</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Vinegar</span>

 
One takes for granted that the <span class="m">mineral salt</span> that looks like <span class="m">marble</span> & is called <span class="m"><span class="pl">Cardona</span> salt</span> in <span class="pl">Catalonia</span> & at the border of <span class="pl">Spain</span>, <span class="del">jec</span> when one heats it red—hot & throws it <span class="del">in the</span> red hot or quite hot into <span class="m">wine</span>, it turns it into <span class="m">very good vinegar</span>. Some make it with <span class="m">water</span> poured on <span class="m">pomace soured</span> after being pressed by <span class="pro">grape pickers</span>, but it will not keep & spoils in heat & <span class="env">thunder storms</span>.
 
 
  

## Buttons of <span class="m">vermeilles</span>

 
Because <span class="m">vermeilles</span> do not fear fire, one cuts them into lozenges flat<span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> on one side, then one joins them together in a star shape in a <span class="m">paste of ground enamel</span>, which one then melts & one <span class="m">gilds</span> the <span class="m">enamel</span> with <span class="m">gold leaf</span> which one reheats.
 
 
  

## <span class="env">Grottos</span>

 
To fill some <span class="env">empty place</span> that cannot be laden with some sort of hanging rocks, one puts a piece of <span class="m">thick parchment</span> close to the fire, which shrinks & crumples. Then one paints it with <span class="m">distemper</span>, then in <span class="m">oil</span>. Next one affixes it.
