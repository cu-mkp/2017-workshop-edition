## <span class="m">Varnish</span> dry in an <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span>

 
Take <span class="m">white <span class="add">turpentine</span> oil</span> <span class="add">&</span> <span class="m">turpentine</span> & <span class="m">mastic, pulverized & passed subtly through a <span class="tl">sieve</span></span>, & boil them together, stirring continuously with a <span class="tl">stick</span> just until it is dry. And put in two <span class="ms">liards</span> of good <span class="m">eau de vie</span>. And if you extract the tear of <span class="m">mastic</span>, it will be whiter & clearer. There is no need to put in <span class="m">turpentine</span>, but only its <span class="m">white turpentine oil</span> & <span class="m">mastic pulverized</span> at your discretion, until it has enough body. \+

This one is excellent for panels and is dry within an <span class="ms"><span class="tmp">hour</span></span> and does not stick like <span class="m">turpentine</span>.
 
 
  

## Cleaning panels

 
Some clean them with <span class="m">soapy water</span>, others with <span class="m">urine</span>, others with <span class="m">white wine</span>, for dust spoils the colors.

** <span class="m"><span class="pa">Spike lavender</span> oil</span> **

 
One ought not to not put any into colors for it is so brisk and penetrating that it makes the colors flake, which next come off. And for this reason, <span class="pro">painters</span> use it to clean their <span class="tl">oil pinceaulx</span> when they have become hard, for it renders them soft & clean immediately, penetrating the dry color which encrusts them. Also, <span class="pro">painters</span>, sometimes envious of the work undertaken by another, <span class="tmp">in the evening</span> secretly pour a few drops of <span class="m"><span class="pa">spike lavender</span> <span class="del">on the</span> oil</span> on the top edge of the panel such that, running down, it makes a stain that penetrates as far as the <span class="m">wood</span> & destroys the colors such that, to make the work even & of an equal composition, they are forced to do everything again and thus lose their work.

 
  

## <span class="m">Wood</span> color

 
 One gives a layer of <span class="m">bistre</span>, then a coat of <span class="m">varnish</span>.

 
  

## Work of the <span class="pl">Flemish</span>

 
They do all their works in <span class="m">oil</span> with the <span class="tl">tip of the pinceau</span>, in <span class="del">f</span> the manner of good <span class="pro">illuminators</span>, and grind their colors very finely, protect against dust, and often clean from their <span class="tl">pinceau</span> the bits of <span class="m">hair</span> which they sometimes leave there, for if these should remain on the work <span class="del">it this</span>, it would prevent neat working, which they are very careful about. In this way their work appears very soft, especially in small work, in which one needs to apply more diligence because one looks at them more closely. They usually finish the forehead, then the eyes, next the nose, finally the mouth and the rest. But they do not proceed like some others who <span class="del">fo</span> layer two or three different flesh tones, one yellowish & the other darker, because the colors always mix & finally die. They simply <span class="del"><span class="ill"></span></span> make their underlayer properly.
