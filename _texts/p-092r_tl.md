## <span class="del">Sand</span>Mixture easy to melt

 
One <span class="del"><span class="ms">℥</span> de</span> <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">soft tin</span>, one <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">fine lead</span>, one <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">looking glass tin</span> & one <span class="ms">part</span> <span class="m">argent vif arresté</span> makes an alloy & a <span class="m">solder</span>, so easy to melt that it can easily be melted in a <span class="tl">dish of <span class="m">fine tin</span></span>.
 
 
  

## Molding a cavity on one side and in relief on the other

 
And for this effect, one casts a medal of <span class="m">fine tin</span>, which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves it in one half of the <span class="tl">frame</span>, & presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you will cast in your <span class="tl">frame</span> some <span class="m">solder</span> described above, or another more meltable than <span class="m">fine tin</span>. And thus, the second medal will melt & mold itself on the first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix some <span class="m">lamp black</span> with <span class="m">water</span>, & with a <span class="tl">pinceau</span>, give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the <span class="tl">frame</span>, & leave to dry. Thus it will not melt.
 
But if you have a medal of <span class="m">copper</span> or <span class="m">silver</span>, you can leave it in the cast, if you want to cast with <span class="m">lead</span> or <span class="m">tin</span>. But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold would make the <span class="m">tin</span> contract.
 
<span class="m">Tin</span> wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.
 
<span class="m">Soft tin</span>, which is the best for the cast, is the one that, once cast <span class="tl">en grille</span>, is <span class="del">burnished &</span> shiny & polished like a mirror, & appears to have been burnished. And has have holes like the one that is brittle, & that is not shiny, as if burnished.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Potin</span>

 
<span class="m">Potin</span>, once cast hot, runs & flows like <span class="m">tin</span>. But the medal becomes whitish from this, and immediately pushes the <span class="m">verd</span> to the surface, which good substances do not do.
 
 
  

## Molding statues

 
<span class="ms">Half</span> <span class="m"><span class="pro">founder</span>’s earth, which <span class="pro">founders</span> use</span>, & <span class="ms">half</span> <span class="m">clay earth</span>, <span class="del">g</span> renders very neatly.
