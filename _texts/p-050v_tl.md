## <span class="al">Little Birds</span>

 
<span class="al">Buntings</span> sing during the night if they are left in the cool open air, but they are better suited to fattening for fine tables than for singing. <span class="al">Chaffinches</span> are prone to blindness, and their eyes swell at the beginning of August. <span class="al">Goldfinches</span> love <span class="m">lettuce seeds</span>, and you can catch them in gardens on seedy lettuce using two <span class="m">lime—twigs</span>. But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for them, they are usually fed with <span class="m">hemp—seed</span>. The <span class="al">owsell</span> is purged with a <span class="al">spider</span>, which you must give it once a week, so that it doesn't become too strong. The <span class="al">lark</span> is purged with <span class="m">dry mortar</span>, composed of <span class="m">lime</span> and sand, to keep it from becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same <span class="m">dry mortar</span>, by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The <span class="al">cuckoo</span> lays its eggs in the nest of the <span class="al">bunting</span>, otherwise know as <span class="al">verdaule</span>. This bird is very simple—minded, I have previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage. To feed young <span class="al">goldfinches</span>, it is necessary to crush <span class="m">almonds</span> with very fine <span class="m">breadcrumbs</span>, and <span class="m">lettuce seeds</span> or <span class="m">hemp seeds</span>. For <span class="al">linnets</span>, some <span class="m">rapeseed</span>.

 
  

## Hot—worked <span class="m">steel</span> and files

 
The <span class="m">steel</span> that <span class="pro">blacksmiths</span> and other <span class="pro"><span class="m">iron</span> workers</span> commonly use is not refined like that from <span class="pl">Germany</span> or <span class="pl">Biscay</span>, which is hardened in a <span class="m">molten iron</span> bath, but among the <span class="m">iron</span> in bars which is transported by flatboat from the forges of <span class="pl">Foix</span> and elsewhere, some is harder, whiter and more refined than the rest, as it comes from the mine. And the <span class="pro">workers</span> choose it and use it like the other <span class="m">steel</span>. And because it consists of <span class="m">common iron</span>, they call it strong <span class="m">iron</span>. But it is not of such good quality as purified <span class="m">steel</span> like that from <span class="pl">Germany</span> and <span class="pl">Biscaye</span>, which is sold in small beads. Some hot—work their <span class="m">steel</span>, giving it a heating and then dipping it into a large quantity of <span class="m">water</span>, then forging it. And fine <span class="m">steel</span>, which is brittle, does break and crumble, whereas <span class="m">iron</span> can be pulled out. Thus they separate the finest <span class="m">steel</span>, which with another heating they make into a mass. The <span class="pl">Germans</span> make their files from strong <span class="m">iron</span>.

> <span class="m">Steel</span> is applied to tools not on both sides, but underneath the part where one sharpens and whets them, and this part must be made of very soft <span class="m">iron</span>.

> <span class="pl">Levantines</span> refine our own <span class="m">steel</span> because their country provides them with none, and they reheat it in a pot with <span class="m">bitumen</span> etc.
