## <span class="al">Little Birds</span>

 
<span class="al">Buntings</span> sing during the night if they are left in the cool open air, but they are better suited to fattening for fine tables than for singing. <span class="al">Chaffinches</span> are prone to blindness, and their eyes swell at the beginning of August. <span class="al">Goldfinches</span> love <span class="m">lettuce seeds</span>, and you can catch them in gardens on seedy lettuce using two <span class="m">lime—twigs</span>. But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for them, they are usually fed with <span class="m">hemp—seed</span>. The <span class="al">owsell</span> is purged with a <span class="al">spider</span>, which you must give it once a week, so that it doesn't become too strong. The <span class="al">lark</span> is purged with <span class="m">dry mortar</span>, composed of <span class="m">lime</span> and sand, to keep it from becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same <span class="m">dry mortar</span>, by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The <span class="al">cuckoo</span> lays its eggs in the nest of the <span class="al">bunting</span>, otherwise know as <span class="al">verdaule</span>. This bird is very simple—minded, I have previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage. To feed young <span class="al">goldfinches</span>, it is necessary to crush <span class="m">almonds</span> with very fine <span class="m">breadcrumbs</span>, and <span class="m">lettuce seeds</span> or <span class="m">hemp seeds</span>. For <span class="al">linnets</span>, some <span class="m">rapeseed</span>.

 
  

## Curried <span class="m">steel</span> and <span class="tl">files</span>

 
The <span class="m">steel</span> that <span class="pro">blacksmiths</span> & <span class="pro"><span class="m">iron</span> workers</span> commonly use is not refined like that from <span class="pl">Germany</span> or <span class="pl">Biscay</span>, which is reduced in hardness <span class="del">p</span> in a bath of a <span class="m">molten iron</span>, but <span class="del">only</span> among the <span class="m">iron bars</span> which are transported in flat ingots from the <span class="env">forges of <span class="pl">Foix</span></span> & elsewhere, there is a harder & whiter & finer kind than the other, as it comes from the <span class="env">mine</span>. And the <span class="pro">workers</span> choose it & use it like the other <span class="m">steel</span>. And because it comes from <span class="m">common iron</span>, they call it <span class="m">strong iron</span>. But it is not as excellent as <span class="m">purified steel</span> like that from <span class="pl">Germany</span> & <span class="pl">Biscaye</span>, which is sold in <span class="ms">small beads</span>. Some curry <span class="m">steel</span>, giving it a heating, then temper it <span class="del">& <span class="m">water</span></span> in a large quantity of <span class="m">water</span>, then forge it. & <span class="m">fine steel</span>, which is brittle, breaks and crumbles, & <span class="m">iron</span> allows itself to be stretched. Thus they separate <span class="m">the finest steel</span> <span class="del">&</span>, which with another heating they reduce to a mass. The <span class="pl">Germans</span> make their <span class="tl">files</span> from <span class="m">strong iron</span>.

> One applies <span class="m">steel</span> to tools <span class="del">dess</span> not on both sides, but underneath the part where one sharpens & whets them. & in this part, they must be of <span class="m">very doulx iron</span>.

> <span class="pl">Levantines</span> refine our <span class="m">steel</span> because their country does not provide them with any. And they reheat it in a <span class="tl">pot</span> with <span class="m">bitumen</span>, &c.
