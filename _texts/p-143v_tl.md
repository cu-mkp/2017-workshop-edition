*[continued]*
  
from one leg to another, so that the spread out limbs are in connection with one another due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which you will start in the waxless round parts that you have put at the edge of the legs to attract the metal. In this way, because you are casting in <span class="m">wax</span>, there is no danger chipping any part of the molded animal. It's quicker to make the <span class="m">wax</span> casting conduits thus, because in this way <span class="sup">you can</span> cast the second mold after <span class="sup">the first</span>, rather than wait to do them <span class="sup">the conduits</span> after the mold has been recooked, because then, if possible, you will need to have everything ready. You need to heat well, and even redden the molds where there are <span class="m">wax</span> conduits so that they melt and leave nothing inside.

 
  

## Openwork carcanets

 
You can mold them en noyau like <span class="al">crayfish</span>, first with one side being made higher with <span class="m">clay</span>, which is hollow, and then you open <span class="sup">it</span> from the other side and make the second casting. You can just as well cast en chassis, provided that they release well. If they do not, you can do a rough cast in <span class="m">wax</span>, or you can fill up the cavities which do not release well with <span class="m">wax</span> or <span class="m">clay</span>.
 
 
  

## <span class="m">Iron</span> filings 

 
Because usually <span class="m">filings</span> are mixed with impurities, it is good to heat them over fire to burn the filth and then wash them in clear <span class="m">water</span>. In this way, the dirt will rise to the top of the <span class="m">water</span>, which you will throw out, and the good filings will go at the bottom.

 
  

## Carnations

 
Because those that you usually cast are generally quite big, they are heavy. And so for these, you make them with <span class="m">silver</span> leaf or slivers.
